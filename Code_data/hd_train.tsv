A lot of smoke and fire flames came out of the blow dryer. Very scary . Do not but this blow dryer it may be okay at first but once you start smelling the burnt smell tuh better think twice when the return days are up. Waste of money! Do not buy this item.

"I've only had this blow dryer for 3 or 4 days, but I already love it. The older one I was using was more than 20 years old and the difference is amazing. I have no idea if the tourmaline or any of the rest of it mean anything, but the difference between this dryer and my old one was great. My old dryer would almost burn my scalp and had only two settings high/hot and low/low. After drying my hair with this new dryer, my hair was silky and soft and, yes, no frizz. It also dried my hair very fast. I used the high speed with medium heat and it was perfect for the drying, then I turned it down to low heat and speed for styling.<br /><br />This dryer has separate buttons for heat and speed. I spent a lot of time staring at the picture that was on this page and could not tell if there were two buttons or just one, so I wanted to mention that, and I uploaded some pictures of the buttons as well. The buttons are next to each other on the handle, on the inside where your fingers grip. The sliding buttons are not easily moved, so it's not likely that you would slide them unintentionally while drying your hair.<br /><br />I ordered and received this blow dryer from Amazon.com, but the dryer they sent me was slightly different from the one pictured here. It looks almost exactly like this one, but the silver design on the side is smooth and it says you on it instead of infiniti and doesn't say Conair underneath, though it does say Conair on the nozzle part of the dryer. Other than that, the dryer they sent me is the same as this one: same specs, same buttons, same cord, so perhaps it's just a newer version of this dryer and the photo is outdated. The dryer I received also looks darker than the one in the picture, but it's a sparkly dark teal that looks very pretty.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it. Before purchasing, I saw the reviews of some that said it didn't last long, but I decided to order it anyway, since I didn't find another I liked better than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I'd only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update. This blow dryer is still great. I love it. My hair has never looked better after blow dryer. I still have the same little quibble that I had before, though: the little tie that is attached to the cord is just much too short. It makes folding up the cord a pain. I have to put my glasses on and struggle with it for several minutes. I have a hand mixer with the exact same type of tie on it. It's just a little longer than this one and it's so easy to attach it. If they'd made this one even a half inch longer, it would have been so easy to use. I will probably try to find some alternative to keep the cord folded up, but they really should have just put one on that was long enough.<br /><br />Even so, the blow dryer is great. I love having different speeds and heat levels. Also, the hottest setting doesn't burn my scalp.etter than this one.

"I bought this expensive T3 Micro Featherweight Luxe Hair Dryer 2.9 pound from TheDiscountCenter. I was guaranteed that it had a 2 year warranty and that they would replace it should anything go wrong with it. Upon arrival it had a broken diffuser. They replaced it. I continued to use the hairdryer and then it eventually stopped working while still under warranty. I contacted TheDiscountCenter to replace the hairdryer. They ignored several emails. I then filed a complaint with Amazon who has also been unhelpful. I am in the process of filing a complaint with headquarters and the Better Business Bureau. Please know that when I contacted T3 direct to see if they would honor the warranty, they said the serial number was a counterfeit. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THEDISCOUNTCENTER, they are liars who are selling counterfeit products through Amazon. What is even worse is that Amazon was notified about this seller back in September and they continue to let them sell products through the website!"	11/1/2013

"I bought this at Target without looking up reviews... mistakes were made.<br /><br />By far, this has been the most annoying hair dryer I've owned.  And trust me, when it comes to a product you're going to be using almost everyday, you do not want it to be annoying.<br /><br />1) STIFF BUTTONS -- The buttons are flush with the surface of the handle, and they're intended to be slid up and down.  Unfortunately, they're incredibly stiff and difficult to move.  I have to use my fingernail every time (which is irritating and uncomfortable), and even then I often have to fidget/wiggle it around.  Sometimes it takes a couple of tries.<br /><br />2) ATTACHMENT FALLS OFF -- Oh man.  Ugh.  I use the concentrator attachment, and seriously, the touch of a feather is enough to knock that thing off the dryer.  Literally every time it falls off in the middle of use.  If not once, then twice, sometimes even three times.  The worst part is that, once it falls off, it then bounces around the bathroom, making a HUGE clattering ruckus, before finally landing somewhere.  This seems to happen most often when other people are still asleep and I'm trying to be quiet.  My boyfriend is always highly amused at the #*$& that comes out of my mouth when this happens.<br /><br />And now, after about a year of frequent use, the dryer has begun to make loud sparking noises.  No visible sparks, just the sound... but I'm not about to wait for actual fire before I toss this.  I'd like to keep my hair, thanks.  I'm already shopping for another one.  Honestly, I'm not even that put out.  It's a relief.<br /><br />The ONE thing I liked about the dryer was its compactness -- because of the retracting cord and folding handle, it took up little space in my bathroom."	2/17/2014

But I was impressed with this dryer because it dried my hair in about 20 minutes! I first started with the brush adapter, but I didn't like it at all. The bristles are too soft. So I changed it to the bigger comb, which I liked. But while drying my hair it then made a crackling popping noise that scared the hell out of me. Then I changed it to the smaller comb, which I also liked, and again it made that horrible scary crackling popping noise! I'm assuming that a hair strand must of gotten inside the vent and that is what cause the popping noise. Also the reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5! All in all I am satisfied with my purchase and blame that on a design flaw. I will be careful using it the next time and hope it doesn't do that again. Also I tried changing the dual voltage.

"In a good, no, a great way! It is a *little* heavier than some models, but I'm only using it for a max of 15 minutes a day so that doesn't bother me. And I only mention it here because many of the reviewers I read listed that as a con. As for how quiet it is, I would say it's as quiet as the other &#34;quiet&#34; dryers I've owned made by other companies. It's not a whisper, but it's not a scream. My hair looks better than it has in a long time... It's certainly shinier and looks thicker when I use this dryer. The dryer is also a very sexy looking piece, so if you're going buy based on looks, go for this machine! The only negative I have is the cold shot button. I foresee this button breaking easily and in the near future. I try to avoid using the shot button in favor of the cold setting switch to prolong the inevitable, though.  I truly do love this dryer.

But my wife has very thick long hair and uses a blow dryer every time she washes her hair. I've kept a close eye on her hair since she started using this dryer and I can't detect any difference either. So I asked her directly, would you pay $130 for this? No, she wouldn't. She said that it's not much different than her $40 dryer.<br /><br />I like the fact that there are two independent controls: temp and air speed. That's nice. I also like the fact that you can override the heat and blast cold air on demand. That's a great touch.<br /><br />But as far as the moisturizing and conditioning aspects, I can't detect them at all. I'm not typically such a skeptic, but when a product costs substantially more than the everyday version that I've been using for years, I need to somehow be convinced and wowed that the product is really worth paying so much more. Unfortunately, I wasn't wowed by this dryer."	12/3/2014

We got less than a year out of this one before the sparks started flying again.  Yes, we kept it clear of lint etc. [it has an easy to remove cap to do this] and the thing does not get daily use.  How one can last 3 years and the next only a year is beyond me.  I gave them a second chance....but no more.  One spark in the eye could ruin your vision for life.  Dangerous product to say the least.<br /><br />Purchased this in 2009 and since the sparks started flying out of the dryer this week I decided to leave a review.  It's worked flawless until today.  My wife was drying her hair and sparks started coming out the end.  This has happened before with other dryers thus the reason for my 4 star review.  I'm buying another one as it will match the holes on the wall that are already there and it's been a nice small hair dryer....and for the price, can't beat it lasting 3 years. Not too concerned about the sparks as the heating wires over time get thin from all the heat...it's almost something you expect to happen and no one was hurt in the process.

"I have very thick and coarse hair and this is the best hairdryer I have owned until now! It gets my hair dry so fast, and the end results are smooth and frizzless hair. With other hair dryers it takes anywhere from 25-35 minutes but this one literally takes 7-10 minutes plus adds more volume to my hair.The heat settings are perfect as well in case someone doesn't want to add too much heat to your hair .. Every dryer I have ever owned did pretty much all the same things but at the end made my hair frizzy and dried my hair out. This dryer is THE ONLY ONE that makes my hair look so beautiful, sleek, soft and shiny! It makes my hair so smooth that I almost don't have to flat iron it since it is naturally wavy.

Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own. So, in that regard, they’re both preferable IMO.<br /><br />Unlike the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that’s so that there aren’t large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair. It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair’s clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn’t give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for “pixiecurling.” For those who don’t know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by “pixiecurl” on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer’s diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn’t on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn’t being pushed away by airflow when you’re positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer. I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyyOypbTHI0&#62;, and it worked great! My hair dried a lot faster, curled really well, and I had no problems with frizz as it finished drying. Although it’s a little difficult to attach initially, the diffuser works really well, and that’s no biggie since I have no reason to keep removing and reattaching it, it just resides on the dryer. So one for Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button. I don’t use high speed because it disorganizes my curls. I’m also unlikely to use hot, but it’s nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time. The Conair has Hi, Off, and Lo, along with a cool shot button, so airspeed and heat, or lack thereof, are connected to each other, and I score another one for the Curlipops.<br /><br />Whine: the Conair has it in spades, and the Curlipops has very little. So I give this one to the Curlipops too.<br /><br />Both dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that’s really the shipping weight. It’s a little more than I’d like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don’t need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it’s still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis. Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair. Both still weigh less than my mother’s non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created. So score one for both pancake dryers. However, neither one has dual voltage, and the Curlipops’s instructions specifically state it should not be used with a voltage converter, so it would not be a possible choice for travel outside of North America.Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.

This is one of those cases. There's no lint on the back that would cause it to overheat or anything. One day it just started switching to a warm/cool setting even though it was set to hot. As time went on, it just doesn't even get hot anymore at all, warm at best. I had this less than 1 year and always kept the back cleared of lint so this is just a junk product. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does come with attachments that similarly priced dryers don't usually come with, and there's a removable cover thing on the lint trap in the back that makes it way easier to clean, you can remove it and wash it off in the sink in 2 seconds.

I was hesitant to try the Sedu 4000i because of some negative reviews but I thought worst case scenario I can return it if I end up not liking it. Sedu 4000i is really small compared to other pro hair dryer. It look sturdy , has a sleek look and weighs 1.2 lbs, weighed not including the cord. Hair dryer's length is 5 3/4 inches ( without the concentrator ) , depth 2 3/4 inches, height ( from top of the dryer to the bottom of the handle ) 7 3/4 inches. Solano 3500 though much bigger than Sedu 4000i just weigh 1 pound. First time I used the Sedu 4000i I was so impressed. It dried my hair way faster ( took only 10 minutes ) than my 4 yr old Conair that burns my hair sometimes. I have long ( mid back ) hair. Medium thickness with some wave and I don't like to use flat iron or any kind of hair products on my hair. ( except shampoo and conditioner ). Sedu is also quieter than my old Conair and Solano 3500. With Sedu 4000i my hair looks so shiny, straight and frizz-free. I keep the ion switch off on my hair dryer because I want some body/volume on my hair. I so love my hair dryer that I am always looking forward to use it. Very highly recommended."	10/29/2012

"LOVE it. Finally a hairdryer that has powerful air, just the right heat settings, and doesn't break the bank. Three heat settings that feel like they should. Cold. Warm. Hot. Two speed settings, high and low. Very happy with the ease of selecting what I want, plus (again) the great air flow.<br /><br />A major plus is not having the high-pitch screeching whine of a Conair or so many other brands. For such power, the Allure 2200W is a relatively quiet dryer. On a noise scale of 10, I would venture to say between &#34;4&#34; and &#34;6,&#34; depending on the settings. For comparison, I would rate most Conairs and probably most other blow dryers I've used at between 7-10. Not dis'ing Conair, just mostly been using that brand for the past decade.<br /><br />My only wish is that the Allure buttons were on the right side (as opposed to facing inside toward your head), as I find the buttons a tad easy to inadvertently press. But that's a personal preference. Maybe you'll like it just the way it is. On the other hand, if you have both left- and right-handed family members, this might be a good solution.<br /><br />Either way, I personally love this dryer. Five stars."	8/14/2015

"The Remington D-2012 is definitely a grade above the $10-$30 hair dryers you see at Target.  Whether or not it is comparable to a CHI, I don't know.  I DO know it is half the price of a CHI, and unlike Farouk (who makes the CHI), Remington will honor the warranty if you buy it on the internet.  The CHI is a solid product so not many people get bitten by the voided warranty when you buy on Amazon, but there's always that chance.<br /><br />The D-2012 has two air speeds and three heat settings.  I use middle heat + low airflow for my short guy hair.  My wife uses high heat + low or high airflow for her long thick hair.  She says it drys so fast that her hair is dry before she has finished styling it.<br /><br />The dryer has a very solid, commercial grade feel to it.  Read this to mean it's heavy compared with basic hair dryers.  I find it to be quieter than my wife's old dryer that claimed to be quiet.<br /><br />All in all this product is a winner if you are looking for a really good solid hair dryer but you don't have the coin for a CHI.

Looks good and performs better.<br />The 1800+ watts drys your hair faster than the typical 1500 watt units most companies sell yet the motor is quieter than these other units.<br />The only point that some may consider a negative is that it isn't very portable. No retracting power cords, no folding handles. But it isn't meant to be portable. Most people use their dryers at home anyway and travelers will have to either accept its somewhat larger size because of its superior performance and lack of carrying case or look for a portable unit.<br /><br />This dryer has three speeds where most dryers only have two. It has three attachments, one is a diffuser (T3 charges an extra $20-30 JUST for their diffuser alone) to puff up your hair with its teeth that have air outlets at the end of each tooth and two different styles of concentrators to develop very high air speeds and concentrate the drying for quicker performance (works great for drying a spill spot on your clothing).<br /><br />It also has a cool button to blow cold air which is handy for spraying hair spray and then fixing your hair in that position. I find it also handy for blowing dust out of the fans and keyboard of my computer as well.<br /><br />Finally, it is not too heavy despite its thicker plastic construction. Some have criticized it as not having a metal body. It disagree, A metal body would be heavier and is also dangerous where electric and water are present, which is where many people use their hair dryers.<br /><br />So not only is a metal body more tiring to use for any amount of time but is hazardous to your heath if used in a bathroom. Pro dryers may be metal bodied but a beauty salon is not a bathroom and it is handled by a beautician, not yourself, so the dangers are minimized a great deal.<br /><br />If you want a pro performing dryer without paying the pro prices ($120-200) they cost, this is the dryer for you."	8/18/2011

"About two years ago, I discovered this product and fell in love quickly only to be disappointed. As a frequent dry shampoo user, I have to say this one has the freshest shampoo-like scent and it really works without leaving a residue. The problem, which I am unable to overcome, is the issue with the sprayer getting clogged. Luckily, I bought my product from a local cosmetics shop and they allowed me to RETURN FOUR BOTTLES in a row. I tried hot water, I tried cleaning the nozzle. I never tried sticking an earring in it like another reviewer suggested, but I had enough. Probably because of their embarassment, one of the cosmetic store employees told me they had heard Ojan was improving their bottle. So I waited diligently for about a year before purchasing another bottle only to find that, just like before, after about 2 uses, the nozzle clogs.     DEAR OJAN - PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR PACKAGING DESIGN SO I CAN CONTINUE TO USE YOUR PRODUCT!!! It is a horrible design flaw that has to cost a ton of money in returns and in loss of potential return customers - LIKE ME!    Now I use Oscar Blandi's power, which is a fabulous product, but sprays are just a little better. I have heard similar reports in Blandi's spray and have avoided it as a result. Fuhrer's didn't really do much for me and a drugstore brand named Salon Grafix (SG) works effectively but smells like old lady hairspray."	8/5/2010

I never use the attachments as my hair is super short (2 inches), I just figured the shape would allow me to straighten my hair more efficiently.  It's a bit cumbersome and heavy.  It gets plenty hot and the low heat setting, although weak, is good for gradual straightening.  I don't like that you have to hold the cool shot button, plus it takes a lot of effort to press.  The button is placed in a very awkward spot for the way I hold it, facing down (again, not typical).  The brush attachment is useless because it's softer than hair!

I am happy to say that I love it.  The chord is nice and long, the buttons are easy to set and do not sit in an area where they are in the way.  The cold shot button must be held down but it shoots out a nice cold blast of air to help set your hair.  The hot setting is super hot but I am sure works well with thick hair.  I mostly use the medium heat without any damage."	5/30/2015

I think its neat because I can change my nail colors more often than what I could in the salon, and the whole reason I liked going to the salon was because I liked nail art, now I can do it myself as often as I like so if I get bored with a color I don't have to wait 2 weeks to remove it, I can redo my nails myself. I only have a few complaints, the full nail designs are a little hard to do across your thumb, I think they could be a little wider and its hard to do on a color wheel (the plastic wheel of nails that people use as swatches in salons) unless you have the double sided stamp and use the small stamper (which works great on like an accent design like a flower or a star but not so well on a full nail design.) It's kind of time consuming and tedious because you have to wipe everything off between each nail. Also if your new at this I recommend starting with a design that doesn't cover the entire nail."	7/2/2011

This blow dryer worked fine for 18 months. However I heard a shriek upstairs when my wife was drying her hair. She said it was on fire and she had unplugged it. I could smell the burning smell. Later that day I started wondering why it hadn't blown a breaker and decided that possible lint had accumulated and touched the burner wire. I did clean out some lint and turned on the dryer to see if I had solved problem. No!  After about 10 seconds smoke came out, there was a burning smell, and the handle got hot. Obviously this is the last of this product for us. The warranty is out by 6 months and if it had just quit working that is one thing. But this is a safety issue and the product should be recalled."	7/11/2015

"As a hair dryer this is a good product, it has plenty of oomph it is not too loud, it looks good.<br />But if you bought it like I did, for styling your hair, using the attachments that came with it, you will be disappointed.<br />the boars hair bristle brush is the only useful attachment out of the 3 that come with it. The other two have barely any room between the bristles, and so unless you have extremely short hair, you are not going to be able to run it through your hair. So you are left with the Boars hair brush. But that too, is pretty much useless, because the bristles are really long, and really weak, they don't get into your hair at all, rather they just skim over the top of it.

I bought this one for my camper and after using it I put my more expensive one in the camper and brought this one in the house. It dries my long hair much faster and somehow leaves it less frizzy.  I was skeptical of the ionic feature but after using it I will not use anything else.  I love it!	11/6/2014

"My previous blow dryer was an Ionic one and it lasted about 10 years. I don't remember the brand, but it was really expensive and high end. I think it was somewhere around $175 new. So, the other day the heat finally went out on it and I needed to replace it. This time, no question, anything other than an ionic simply won't do. Anyways, I found this one and just used it for the first time with a completely wet head and I am so impressed, I can't even believe it!! I'm not sure if the ion charges on my old dryer had gradually worn out, or if the technology now is just that much better? But I couldn't be happier. It took all of 10 minutes to completely dry and style my hair and it looks amazing, with VERY little frizz and enhanced the shine too. My other blow dryer had been taking me more like 15 minutes. This Remington does have greater watts / power too, but even on the lower setting, my hair was getting dry faster and styling perfectly. I should also mention the design is really neat looking too. It does not feel as heavy (quality) as my other one and the precision (extra) part felt like it was made kind of cheap. But, of course! My other one was about four times more expensive. As long as this one doesn't break anytime soon, I am sure I will be VERY happy with it! (No need for me to add the benefits of the ionic vs the regular blow dryer, you can find that info just about anywhere on the net). I completely recommend this product!"	3/12/2012

It's sleek and it's quiet. It's a bit heavier than my old Conair, but not so heavy as to be uncomfortable to hold. In fact, it has a very nice, slim grip and I like the matte finish. My hair is indeed shinier, as promised. An unexpected extra is that it stays straighter, a real bonus in heat and humidity. I may never use the attachments (diffuser and focused stream) but it's nice to have them. I'm enjoying my new dryer and look forward to a long relationship."	8/16/2015

When I saw this one, I was pretty much mesmerized - not only did it come with attachments( including the diffuser), but it was pink and it a had button that would reel the cord in for you. When I got it though, did that remain true? Yes! the length of the cord might not be the longest but it isn't short either- it's a rather standard size I suppose. It works perfectly like any other blowdryer. I think the only reason I am putting four stars at this point is because after being so into the reeling feature , the reel started having problems about 2-3 months into owning the blowdryer. Was it serious? No, I can still push the cord into the blowdryer and everything is working fine. So if this isn't going to be a problem with you I'd recommend it. It was a good buy, and I ended up coming back and buying another one of these for a friend."	6/17/2014

I bought it as a replacement after my second Revlon dryer bit the dust. I use it on the Low/Warm setting and it's just perfect for my hair type (thin/damaged hair), not too hot, but not too cold. Dries my hair super fast too, literally under 5 minutes and done. My other 2 hair dryers hardly put out any heat on the medium settings and took forever to dry my hair. Very happy with this since again, my hair is already damaged from heat.<br />I really love the comb attachment it came with too. I've never seen anything like this before. After your hair is dry/almost dry, if you put the dryer on the low/hot with the attachment on, it really helps with straightening your hair and pretty much eliminates the need for a flat iron, another huge plus. It comes with a concentrator attachment too, but I don't use that.<br />The dryer is very lightweight, quiet,  the cord is short so you're not tripping all over it, but there's still enough length to work with without pulling it out of the wall.<br />This is a great little hair dryer over all for a small price."	3/11/2013

"I bought this to replace my &#34;Conair Infinity Pro&#34; hairdryer. What attracted me to this Andis was the &#34;salon grade&#34; and the ionic/ceramic attributes. Overall this is a good hair dryer, but it doesn't blow as hard as the Conair it replaced. This was HUGE for me, as I like a good air flow. It takes longer for my wife to dry her hair because of it, so we went back to our old brand. It does, however, leave your hair &#34;silkier&#34; which was a surprise to me. I didn't think an ionic dryer could do that, but it does. The two settings it has for wattage didn't seem to make much of a difference, but it's a nice touch. I'm sure there's a reason for the option, but I can't think of anything it's useful for. I put it on the high setting and let it go. The retractable cord is nice, but it doesn't reel the cord all the way in, leaving about 16in left dangling. After a few weeks of use, it reels in even less, now leaving about 20 or so inches hanging.<br /><br />Pro: Silky hair, somewhat retractable cord, two wattage settings (that I'll prob never use).<br />Con: Takes longer to dry long, thick hair as the air current isn't as strong as I'd like.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it, but if you don't mind a slightly weaker air flow, the ionic silkiness is worth it."	4/8/2015

Among its better aspects, the dryer is attractive, lightweight, and marvellously quiet. It has a cool shot as well as three heat settings which get warm enough to dry hair quickly, without frying it.    The dryer comes with an attached hook from which it can be hung, as well as a diffuser and a concentrator. The result is sleek, straight, or wavy hair -- depending on which attachment you use. I highly recommend this dryer. I can find nothing negative to say about it.    So... there ya go!"	3/1/2011

It straightens it so fast which really saves me on time. I have small hands so the way this dryer is shaped makes it easy to hold and use. It isn't very heavy which adds to its ease of use.<br /><br />Out of the three attachments, I use the &#34;big comb&#34; right after washing my hair and the &#34;small comb&#34; for touch ups. I would say without a good thermal balm, heat protectant, etc... It make be a little freezy. Since my hair is so curly, I am uses to using such products so if you dont, you may want to.<br /><br />The heat dial only has 3 ranges which I thought would be an issue. I would say medium is good for most people. I have never had a problem with not getting the right temperature for my needs.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with my purchase.

However, I am all too familiar with the noise they make when my wife is drying her hair in the morning.  To me, her 10 year old hair dryer sounds like a mini jet engine.  I asked her to give this hair dryer a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that the hair dryer did not wake me up in the morning when my wife was drying her hair.  The hair dryer does not have that high pitch noise that makes it sound like a jet engine.  It makes a noise that I have not heard in a hair dryer before.  I would call it more of a low roar versus the high shriek of the older models.<br /><br />My wife was very impressed with the effectiveness of the dryer.  She said that it dried her hair in about half the time as her old dryer.<br /><br />The dryer does feel like it was build solid.  The outside casing has a rubbery type feel as opposed to the hard smooth plastic most dryers are made of.<br /><br />My wife is thrilled with how fast it dries her hair.  Personally, I love the fact that it is quiet and doesn't wake me up in the morning when she dries her hair (I work the graveyard shift so this is important to me).  So far, this is an excellent product and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone."	11/23/2010

Longer dry time, but better results."	"I have used other hair dryers from Xtava, and this one is by far my favorite. The other one was great for quickly drying my hair, but it left my ends feeling really dried out. This one takes a little longer to dry my hair, but it leaves my hair feeling so soft and not damaged at all.<br /><br />This dryer is very easy and pretty straight forward to use. There are three heat settings on the heat switch, three speed settings on the speed switch, and a cool shot air button. On the heat switch you will find low, medium, and high temperatures. On the speed switch you will find off, gentle, and strong. The cool shot button is used to set your style. I like to use this dryer on him heat and strong speed. I use a round brush to style my hair, then the cool shot to set.<br /><br />The dryer comes with two attachments, a concentrated and a diffuser. The diffuser is great for those with curly hair who want to reduce frizz. The connector is great for people who have straight hair. It really helps me style my hair straighter, without needing a straightener.<br /><br />I really like how hight weight this dryer is. I have been having some weird back/shoulder problems over the last couple years, so the lightweight hair dryer is something that I can really appreciate. I have small hands and I think that this is very easy to hold.<br /><br />The hair dryer is quite and while it might not have the power you are used to, it works great. I like that my hair appears to be far less damaged with this dryer than any other i have used, and it only takes a couple more minutes to dry. That is a tradeoff I am more than willing to make. This is the dryer I will continue to use on a day to day basis. Like others, I did receive this to review, what I have written is honest. I would not mislead consumers as I would not want to be mislead. This is a product that I stand by."	3/4/2015

"Quality: This is the best hair dryer I have used. Hands down. My favorite feature is that it doesn't produce a ton of noise like the T3 I previously had, and if you have a sleeping baby in the next room you'll really appreciate the low noise it makes. The performance is perfect and the temperature and fan speed are fully adjustable. I set mine on negative ion, which helps my hair look great before work and after the gym. My wife and I share it and she's as satisfied with the quality as I am.<br /><br />Price: For the price, you can't beat this dryer. I paid over $200 for a T3 and the Onei feels, looks, and sounds like a better product. The performance of both are good, but the Onei has more adjustment options, so I have to rate it higher.<br /><br />Shipping: I came back from a two-day business trip and it was waiting for me, even though I didn't expect it for a week or so. Of course the wife got to it first :)<br /><br />Customer Service: The seller sent me a nice email to make sure I was satisfied with the quality and shipping speed. I couldn't ask for better customer service.<br /><br />Overall: Highly recommended, both dyer and seller. Thank you!"	3/25/2013

The wats is 1300 which not 1875 like other dryers. It's better for ur electric bill. It's veryyyyy hot on the hot setting. So I think medium setting is best where it's still hot but bearable. The cool setting feels mediocre cool. And the burst is actually cold. Let me tell u. Ive had this dryer at least 2 yrs. I used it an entire winter season to warm up a 15x16 room. It ran 6 hrs straight every day. N the motor died at the end of the season. I wouldn't recommend this b done. It's was just my experience with this dryer. Just letting u know its a strong dryer long lasting if used the correct way. It's not light weight. But very well built. It's had many hard falls to the floor over the yrs. Also it has a safety feature on the plug housing to not turn on if theres an electrical feed interference in a socket. To reset it just press the bottom on the plug.  Im shopping for the same one.	3/31/2014

"I really wanted to love this product. It worked great for about a month, then I noticed it started sparking! Initally I thought it was because I left it on the high heat setting everytime I used it; however, the sparks began occuring more often and I could smell it burning. I still gave it benefit of the doubt and figured there was just a faulty piece in the dryer and I happened to be the lucky person who bought it, so I threw it away and bought the same hair dryer thinking this time it would work. It worked great for about two months and then it started throwing out blue sparks again! I have used the dryer at my house & while on vacation out of state and it still sparks regardless of where I plug it in. I hate to bad mouth any product from Remington because I am a fan of their other products, but I just don't see how this can just be a coincidence. When I contact Remington, I can never get through directly to someone. It's not really worth trying to get them to send me a new one--I have learned my lesson once and for all.

When it arrived, it was not as large as I thought it would be...that's a good thing when you're tight on storage space. I would say this is a mid-size hairdryer. Not the full gigantic salon-sized version nor the mini travel version. It doesn't seem too noisy when on and the volume of air it blows is pretty decent.<br /><br />The overall construction is as you would expect for the price...a glossy smooth plastic outer shell surrounding the internal heating/electrical/mechanical workings. The switch is easy to manipulate into the desired setting: down for low and up for high. The cool shot button allows the hairdryer to ramp up into the high mode but blow out cool air. The filter cover on the end of the hairdryer is easy to remove by twisting off. I prefer this type of filter cover over the hinged version that you cannot run under the sink for a good cleaning. If you ever rinse the filter cover, make sure it is absolutely dry before putting it back on the hairdryer as water and electricity do not mix! On the topic of electricity, the hairdryer also features a GFCI plug in case your bathroom doesn't have a GFCI outlet. This feature trips the power off to your hairdryer in case it comes into contact with water, preventing electrocution.<br /><br />The weight is decent and lightweight, not too heavy to hold while drying your hair. The handle could be a bit more comfortable, but for the money I cannot complain that much.<br /><br />I don't know about durability, but I think it was a decent purchase and very utilitarian."	1/26/2013

It's a bit on the heavy side, and doesn't have that grip coating that some of the other brands have. I give it one star because I was using it two weeks ago and it caught on fire.  Thick gray smoke with a burnt plastic smell.  I contacted customer service through their website but they didn't respond at all.  I don't think it's designed to handle the heat it puts out.  Nevertheless, I'm out a pretty expensive professional dryer that only lasted a year.  Will not buy this one again, but will look for one that's comparable."	9/7/2011

After my last hair dryer croaked I read many reviews and ordered the highly-rated Revlon Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer. That one actually took curl and body OUT of my hair and left it limp and hard to style. So I went hunting for a non-ionic dryer and chose this one, not at all sure I was happy paying $75 for a hair dryer. But I am indeed happy and would gladly buy it again. Styles my hair nicely with no frizz. I've used it for more than 3 years and it still works perfectly. The only flaw is some bare spots where the color scratched off in putting the dryer in and out of a drawer--not that I care one whit about the paint job on my hair dryer. I've rated it four stars rather than five simply because it's large."	1/30/2013

My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That's the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I'm styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that's for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don't remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it's common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I'd mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open & clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan & on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway 'cause  I'm impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it's still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn't include this feature because she doesn't use it  but I wouldn't buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don't use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it's not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It's the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it's been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You'll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it's a great value. In my area Target & Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat."	1/1/2012

We have a big family and own several Remington hairdryers. This one is in the kids bathroom. With its smaller grip it's a good size for older kids and teens to use. It dries hair fairly quickly, on par with most other dryers we've owned. We keep it on a command adhesive hook above the outlet to the side of the sinks. The cord has a good sized built in loop for hanging.<br /><br />I was really happy to find that it comes with both a wide, flat nozzle for straightening as well as a diffuser for curly styles. My fancy high end dryer didn't come with a diffuser and it took forever to find one that fit. I also like that it has a cool button, no need to slide a button up and down to set a style with cool air.<br /><br />My one complaint is that this dryer is a bit noisier than the other Remington dryers we have. It's not so noisy that it consider it loud for a hairdryer but if you're searching for a quiet model know this one is average to slightly above average as far as noise goes.<br /><br />All in all I'm impressed with this hairdryer. It's a fantastic value at this price point. All our other Remington's have lasted years."	8/11/2015

Who says a Grandma can't be cool with a new blinged out T3?	3/18/2009

It shows in the products that they make for the general consumer.<br /><br />Bought this model because of the retractable cord.  Great feature if you don't leave your blow dryer on the counter all day and are sick and tired of wrapping five feet of cord around the handle every time you're done.  It hangs up when it retracts every once in a while, but it keeps the cord out of the way.<br /><br />This model has more settings than you can think up reasons for.  Two power settigs - 1875W and a second lower setting I never use.  Three heat settings and three blower settings.  And then add a cold blower setting.<br /><br />Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I also bought an Andis traveler blow dryer (RC-2) for the gym (w/ retractable cord and folding handle) that I like better;"	8/26/2013

And ... that unit still runs but the thermocouple switch that shuts the unit off when it overheats has &#34;worn&#34; over the years and has begun to engage a little too quickly. (Note that not keeping the lint filter clean will cause this issue as well, due to restricted airflow over the thermocouple).<br /><br />Indeed, a pretty darn good unit for the money. After a couple of years of use (literally, used hundreds of times in that period) the &#34;ears&#34; or &#34;fingers&#34; that hold the dryer became worn, or loose, so the hairdryer would fall out. This was solved by placing a strip of Velcro on the inside of each &#34;ear&#34;.  Would have given product 5 stars if this had not occurred. Found that this easy &#34;repair&#34; needs to be repeated every couple of years.<br /><br />From my experience, definitely would not hesitate to recommend. Conjecture is that those who experienced short life with this appliance may not have cleaned the lint filter as often as required. From personal experience I know it's easy to put this little chore off. If you have had this product only a few months and you start experiencing the unit shutting off before your hair is dry - this is the thing to check."	6/7/2015

It's got a more quiet engine but still dries fast and I love the retractable cord. I recommend dryers like this though for households where it is only being used once or twice daily, because the engines aren't super powerful for professional use and the retractable cord does have a shelf life. Of course I've had my dryer for months now and it's all working great still, but if you have daughters or someone sharing it and they aren't careful when using it, or just using it too much, it will break eventually. Also- great tip for using the retractable cord- always pull the cord down at a casual pace, don't just yank it. Also, when pressing the button for it to go back in, what I do is grab the plugin and hold it really close to wear the retractable entry is and then hold down the button. It keeps from the plugin slapping everything in the area."	9/4/2014

In fact, it really is the best blow dryer I've ever had. The only reason I couldn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the button that retracts the cord. It was placed on the side of the dryer where it sticks out, so that when you put the dryer down in between blows, it pushes the button and startles me as it trys to retract. It should have been made so that the button recedes a bit so it isn't accidently pushed. But, all in all, it is great.

I have read all these reviews about the Revlon RV484 today which is 2/3/2014 and even on this date the Revlon hair dryer that I purchased last summer did the same thing...the cord split where it meets the dryer and a large set of sparks and horrid smell of burning electric permeated my house. What the heck!!!!! People have complained about this product since back in 2007 and it still remains on the market?????? I will contact Revlon and hopefully this dryer will be pulled off the market before some young adult gets seriously hurt or burnt. Very poor design...shame on Revlon!	2/3/2014

My skin is brighter, cleaner, and my dark spots has lightened after 2 uses. I will most definitely purchase more of this soap and will use it as a bath soap as well.

It is extremely light, not very noisy, and the buttons are in the right place. The cord is a little short (about 62 inches) but for a tiny New York bathroom with an electrical outlet at a waist level it is actually perfect. However, I can see how it can be trouble if your electrical outlets are low.<br /><br />I can't tell if the ionic feature does what is supposed to do because I had not owned a hair dryer before this one for a long time so I can't compare. I have very thick just-below-the-shoulders hair and it takes me about 5 minutes to dry it. It still gets static in winter.<br /><br />I like the simple white and black color. To me it looks much better than the silver finish on higher-end driers because they still look like plastic and fake and this one is not pretending to be what it is not. The painted text to identify on/off and temperature settings wore off in two days but the settings are intuitive and so you don't really need the text once you saw what is where. I've had it for just under a year and it is working just fine. All in all great purchase."	6/10/2012

Ended up returning it because I couldn't get used to it.<br /><br />It blow dries your hair really fast, but that's only when it's on the correct setting, which I kept changing with a slight tough of my hand.

"From the start I wasn't totally happy with this hair drier, but decided to make do anyway.  (Too much hassle to return it.)  The toggle switch was difficult to use and when I wanted curls in my hair, for some reason I couldn't make it work as well with this one.  (Do the ion driers straighten the hair?)  The higher speed/temperature is too hot, but the lower one takes too long to dry my hair.    The worst of it started about two months ago when it started slowing down after a minute or so of use.  I didn't think much about it other than realizing I'd probably need to replace it soon.  Then this morning as I was drying my hair, I happened to see it in the mirror as it slowed down.  It was throwing sparks when it slowed!  I was lucky my hair hadn't caught fire!  Needless to say it has been discarded, and today (Thanksgiving Day) I have one more thing for which to be thankful - I was protected from a fire."	11/26/2009

"I broke my wife's Babyliss TT 3000 dryer (guess they don't bounce), so I had to buy her a replacement.  She has fine hair that lacks body.  As I researched dryers I read that people with fine hair will get better volume & body if they don't use NEGATIVE Ion dryers but instead use NEUTRAL Ion dryers.  The price on the MK-II was about $30 more than the TT3000 (which she liked) but I thought that with all the 5 star comments (i.e. lighter weight, quieter, 4 yr warranty, etc.) it was worth it, especially since it had a Negative/Neutral Ion switch.  When it came I mentioned all of its advantages to her.  I was crushed when her first comments were:<br />1. Yes, its quieter than the TT3000 but that's because on high fan the air volume was equal to the low fan speed of the TT3000.<br />2. No, the neutral Ion setting didn't give her any more body/volume than the TT3000 did.<br /><br />It is 2.5 ounces lighter than the TT3000 (according to our digital postage scale) and she's OK with it's performance so I'm not sending it back but I wished I'd just gotten another TT3000 and saved the $30.  Maybe a $180 unit with neutral Ion's would give her more volume but I do know that if this one breaks I'm not buying another MK-II.  Sure wished someone would have posted a comment like this one so I didn't waste my money.  Personally, I like the build quality of the TT3000 also."	3/13/2014

I always wondered why it seems faster to dry my hair at the salon than at home. She said something about ionic hairdryers that not only speed up the drying time, but takes away unwanted frizzy hair. She said to buy a ceramic brush as well to help with drying and to prevent frizzy hair. After purchasing this hairdryer and the right brush, I am able to dry my hair in 5 minutes as opposed to 15 minutes with a hairdryer bought at like CVS or Rite Aid. I have really thick, medium length hair. Where I live where it gets humid from time to time, my hair does get frizzy. After buying this hairdryer, time and frizz were no longer an issue. My husband even commented on how fast I have been able to dry my hair. I figured if he noticed, then I believe I made the right purchase. This hair dryer is a &#34;game changer&#34;.

I was able to buy those (the old ones) at the big W (you know where) for a reasonable price, but they would die about every 6 to 12 months. When the last one died, they didn't have any on the shelf (go figure). So I tried to find a replacement with this one.<br /><br />It's a shiny red color, but since it spends most of it's life in the cabinet under my sink, I don't think that's a big selling point. I like that this one has a retracting cord, and the fact that it doesn't fold in half like my old ones hasn't been a problem, so far. In fact, it's probably an engineering upgrade. I imagine the folding types break more easily.<br /><br />When I first started using it, it seemed to take a bit longer than average to dry my hair, but after a few uses, it seems to be &#34;broken in&#34; now. I like that it has cold, warm or hot options and low or high speeds. So, all in all, it does the job for a reasonable price and offers the retractable cord (which is a must for those of us who a bit OCD). Only gave it 4 stars because, well, it's not made of gold (which would probably melt from the heat anyway)."	6/18/2013

"There's a learning curve with this dryer. What I've learned:<br /><br />1. Don't dry your hair all the way (if it's curly) The frizz will erase all the work you just did.<br />2. Place your hair cradled in the dryers teeth and THEN turn it on. Hold for as long as you need, then turn the dryer off before moving to a new section. Any time this dryer is not full of hair and right up next to your scalp, it's making a frizz mess.<br />3. After drying 75% of the way, stop and clip up your roots to avoid flat head. I find that the hair next to my scalp is still a little damp and susceptible to flatness.<br /><br />It's a fine dryer, and I use it occasionally when I'm in a hurry, but for curly hair (I'm a 2c/3a with fine hair) I find it's always best to air dry."	7/16/2015

For the past few months I've been making do with it because I don't have the receipt to return it.  This dryer hood does not click into place and is not height adjustable.  I will say again  -  This dryer hood does not click into place and is not height adjustable.  Once it is set up you must slide this terribly inadequate plastic catch up the back of the hood to hold it in place.  Oh and you have to do that after you are sitting under it.  So you have to reach up over and behind your head and the hood to fix (notice I didnt say 'lock')the hood in place. If you set it up before you sit under it and happen to tip it ever so slightly it will collapse. If you so much as sneeze while under this dryer the hood will fall and hit you in the face.  I have not used it one time without this happening.  I miss my Lady Daisy terribly and this dryer makes me miss it more.  This dryer is also very loud.  Like shop vac loud with a strained whistle going at the same time.  It's just that bad.  I wish I never purchased it and can't wait to replace it.  If you need cheap heat this is fine.  If you are a die hard at home roller setter/wrapper/deep conditioner/wet setter/braid setter/twist outer/style molder/colorer then please spend a few extra coins for a better dryer.	2/19/2013

"This is the first hair dryer I have ever owned that did not leave my hair smelling like smoke.  I am a black woman with natural hair (absolutely no chemicals nor weave) and my hair is more susceptible to dryness and breakage.  Therefore, it is extremely important for me to be extra sensitive and mindful to the type of products I use on my hair. This dryer did not pull my hair out, no burnt smell and I didn't mind the sound quality, afterall it is a hair dryer not a fan. The only negative I have is that the buttons can easily be depressed while blow drying your hair.  So you may have to double check a few times as I did to make certain you are using the right temperature on your hair.  Here is a tip I learned, when planning on using hot curlers, flat irons etc. please cool your hair down first (the cool shot button truly does help)and use a non-buildup non-oily heat treatment.  The more natural and/or organic the better. Wait at least 10 minutes or longer before proceeding to styling. Heat from the dryer with immediate usage of other heat sources can cause stress and unnecessary damage (or more damage) to your scalp and hair. Also, when using the pik, if you come in contact with a tangle, PLEASE do not force the pik thru.  You will tear your hair apart.  Use your fingers or a detangler comb to separate the tangle, then proceed in continuing drying."	2/24/2014

"Got this hairdryer a few days ago. I had to go with a lower watt dryer otherwise I'd be flipping breakers every 5 minutes. It's very pretty. I dig the red.  It took a couple days to get used to holding it as it's a bit bulky. But to be fair my other one had a shorter nozzel and was lighter.  The placement of the setting switches is not optimal. I can't easily switch from low to high and back to low without looking at what I'm doing.  And the hot setting is not very hot. Which, I guess, my hair is thankful for.  But boy does she have great blowing power! It's like being in a wind tunnel. My hair dries in half the time now which is great!  I have used both attachments that came along with it too. I was afraid due to the force of the blowing it would blow those little gadgets right off and smack me upside the head but they stayed put.  The blow dryer is a little louder than I am used to but not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the product. I can overcome the negatives. Hope it lasts!<br /><br />_________________<br /><br />REVIEW EDITED SEPT 2013 =  And there she blows...out!  The heating element died already.

"I picked this out because of the cord-keeper design, and it replaced my functioning 1875 watt non-tourmaline dryer. Unless you really want a cord-keeper dryer or have already chosen the ~$30 price point, I might look around more before settling on this one. However, it does the job and I'm going to keep it. Personally, I wish I hadn't been so desperate and had spent a little more time looking, but I'm also willing to spend a little (or a lot) more money for something I won't want to replace later.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* cord-keeper - no tangled cords!<br />* good wattage - fast dry<br />* tourmaline does soften hair - noticeable, but subtle<br /><br />Cons:<br />* heavy - I like to hold the dryer vertically above my head and it's significantly heavier than a non-tourmaline.<br />* large - this is above average in size, don't think you're going to travel with it.<br /><br />Some low-star reviewers mentioned the finish coming off on their hands, and I'd just like to clarify that is a random flaw in their dryers. I have porcelain skin and use this on the highest setting for about 20-30 minutes and have not seen any finish come off - so if you're worried about that, it's not the norm.<br /><br />As far as this being a tourmaline dryer, it's an upgrade from non-tourmaline; the technology used dries the water on your hair and you should see less heat damage. In my perception, it does not dry any faster than a non-tourmaline at the same wattage."	4/21/2013

For example, the air flow seems to come out of the unit at a strange angle. I've used the dryer for several weeks and I still haven't figured out how to make the most of the air. The temperature of the air is fine, and velocity is as expected for a 1600 watt unit, the direction is off. I was a bit disappointed by the knob to switch the voltage. You need a coin to turn the selection, and the plastic is so cheap that it was immediately, and permanently, gouged. If this unit cost $10, like some at Target, I would expect that, but this is priced in a way that one expects better quality. I don't think I'd buy this unit again."	4/30/2014

My advice to those with sensitive teeth:  rather than buying these strips, buy the originals or an upgraded version and use them less often than as directed to reduce sensitivity.  Use them once every few days or once a week rather than the recommended once or twice a day.  You will still get great results, but giving your teeth a break in between uses will dramatically decrease any pain from sensitivity."	8/5/2010

At first, it leaves somewhat of a greyish cast but i think this neutralizes yellowish asian undertones once product settles into skin.  Later skin79 gold adjusts a bit to my skin color though i think it is a tad light for me.  i think longevity is about 3-4 hours with primer so i put a finishing powder (drugstore brand) over it so it would last 6-8hrs?  Using a powder similar to your coloring will help make this skin79 product 'match up' to ur skin coloring (IF you are about nc30 or more).  I really think powdering is a must for this product.  Honestly, i have to have powder for this or it wont last long and coloring looks  a bit off.  It isnt drying, and u dont become 'oily' after several hours (not quite dewy but healthy moisturized skin).  You never feel u r wearing makeup with this on (even with primer + BB cream +powder).<br /><br />Compared to other products:  i feel it does 'brighten' the face a bit compared to the other skin79 sampler items.  I found oriental bb gold too oily at the end of day (though loved its initial dewiness),  pink one made my skin look dead and didnt last long and blemish diamond bb cream was too sparkly to use.  I have also used Sephora and laura merceir oil-less tinted moisturizer and found these too oily and 'dead-looking' respectively on my skin.  Laura mercier brand oxidized way too much for me and made me feel like i was wearing a fake mask at end of the day (i even tried 2-3 different shades!).  Christian dior TM broke me out as well as the other skin79 items esp. oriental bb gold.<br /><br />this is a good product to be honest...despite of the minor negatives above esp. not matching to skin color and lack of longetivity without use of powder.  I really think this works great with powder atop of it.<br /><br />if i get a chance will post comparable pics here in amazon.shades!).

Make your life easy...use two-sided tape rather than drilling holes into your cabinet.  This way you won't damage the cabinet if/when you remove it.

"My old hair dryer died a rather spectacular death with sparks and smoke.  I hadn't researched hair dryers before, and I only wanted something that would dry my hair.  So I randomly picked a conair from a local store.  I used it a few times and was not happy with the results for the conair.  It turned out to be loud as all get out, and my hair turned out flat.  I felt like I was in a deafening windstorm.  So now I had a criteria for research:  Something that was quiet and didn't blow my hair into a limp state.  That's what lead me to this Remington.  It shipped and got here quickly.  Yes, it smelled a bit funny as all new hair appliances do when first used, but I was impressed.  It was easy to handle.  I liked that I didn't have to keep sliding buttons up and down to change settings like my old hair dryer.  It was relatively quiet as hair dryers go.  The drying process went very quickly.  My hair had plenty of volume with a smooth, soft feeling when all was said and done.  I'm very happy.  No flat hair and my ears aren't ringing.

The amount of 'hair static' effect seems reduced vs. my previous hairdryer.  The unit is a bit heavier than I expected, but the weight is balanced so handling is fine.  It's quieter than I expected even at full speed.  The cord is longer than needed in my personal situation, I find a cord that long just gets in the way.  The cord is straight, not coiled.  The big block thing at the end of the cord (vs. just an AC power plug) I find a nuisance since my power outlets are already GFCI-type outlets. Basic controls are fan & heat: 2 fan speeds + off & 2 temperatures + off.  The number of temperature settings advertized is a bit misleading - (&#34;4 temperatures&#34; is actually achieved by a combination of temperature switch & fan switch settings.)  Instructions (for English anyway) are generally lacking, but with a bit of experimentation one can figure out how to work it.  I rate the dryer 4 stars primarily for these reasons:  The &#34;Removeable stainless filter&#34; is a nice feature so hair clogs on the inlet can be removed, but getting it all back in place is not easy, it takes careful manipulation because the parts are not finely fitted and they bind easily (at least on my unit.)  Because of the binding and poor fit, I was afraid of breaking something in the precess of putting it back together after cleaning the filter.  The ad says: &#34;Includes concentrator&#34; - I assume this is supposed to be an attachment to put on the nozzle, my unit did NOT come with any extra parts.  All things considered I think it's overpriced and in some ways the ad is misleading.  I do intend to keep it, but will shop around again if I ever need another."	5/13/2013

I then bought a Conair Infinit Pro at a local store which seems much better heat wise.<br /><br />edited May 19, 2013: Returned the Infiniti Pro as well and bought a Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer. As I posted in my review for the Remington (which I didn't buy on Amazon but was so happy with it I wanted to write a review about it):<br /><br />I bought this hair dryer locally after 2 strikeouts on other dryers. First I had purchased the Revlon Matte Chrome Full-Size Turbo Hair Dryer - RV473V1 on Amazon, but sent it back as it only got lukewarm. Then I bought a Conair Infiniti which I also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted. I figured it was because the opening of the nozzle was too big, so I set out to find one that was narrower. This dryer works perfectly. Doesn't get too hot, has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it. Good attachments, lightweight, not really loud, removable filter. Ionic/ceramic. The color is not my favorite, but what matters is it works."	5/9/2013

"I bought this hairdryer because my last Conair had finally conked out after about 15 years.  I took it out of the box to test it, plugged it in, turned it on and almost immediately decided to return it.  I liked to use the hot setting on my old dryer, so I kicked the temperature setting up to hot on this one and was stunned to find that the warm setting is actually hotter than the hot setting.  The hot setting was barely warmer than the cool setting.  Something is seriously wrong with that.  Also, the cord was very difficult to retract.  I can understand why so many people say that the cord keeper function stopped working after a very short time.

"I was in desperate need of a new blow dryer but very hesitant to purchase because I have attempted twice over the years to get a new, updated one but both broke quickly and didn’t work as good as my 15 year old blow dryer. The Xtava Rimini 1500W Ionic Hair Dryer really surprised me. I mean, really. First, it is insanely lightweight (I think they say “ultra-lightweight”). There are 3 heat levels and 2 power levels and it comes with two attachments - a diffuser to help eliminate frizz and give more volume and a Concentrator Nozzle for focusing on just one area of your hair to dry that area more rapidly.<br /><br />Now, for how it performed - I have long, wavy, medium-thickness hair (and lots of it) that tends to get frizzy with heat products (so I limit them!) I generally spend 35-40 minutes to get this hair dried with a blow dryer. This, combined with the fact that I was in a bad car accident and it can get really painful when I am styling my hair for so long means I throw mousse in and let it air-dry wavy/curly more often than not. NOT ANYMORE. I LOVE this hair dryer.<br /><br />It took only 20 minutes to completely dry my hair with the diffuser. And, my hair looked FABULOUS. It made my hair so smooth and soft and with no frizz!!! I didn’t need to use extra smoothing lotions or serums like I usually do! The cool shot button helps to “set” the style and it also helps reduce frizz and boost shine (my old one didn’t have one of these!)<br /><br />I cannot recommend this enough! I wish Amazon wasn’t out of stock so I could purchase one for my sister. She’s always replacing hair dryers too!<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.*"	3/20/2015

After spending some nights in motels with wall mounted hair dryers I wanted one. Sunbeam seemed the most popular and best. So I bought this one.<br /><br />Minor complaints:<br />  *  Power cord to outlet is too short for my situation. I live in an apartment. Outlet is on one side of the hand towel rack; I had to mount it on the other side so the cord is flopping at a diagonal under the towels. I wanted to mount the dryer higher but the cord wouldn't reach.<br />  *  I also use the dryer to other parts of my body due to psoriasis which is aggravated by moisture and  my feet which are prone to moisture related problems and the cord between the base and the dryer makes doing this awkward.<br />  *  Night light is OK doesn't affect my sleep. But if I had known it was available without the night light I would have bought that instead.	6/3/2014

I purchased a hairdryer at a local beauty supply chain, thinking that it would work about as well as my dearly departed one. Wrong! It left my hair feeling very dry, in spite of the product I use on my hair prior to blowing it dry. I was going to invest in a CHI, but after reading mostly negative reviews on that model, I decided to save my money and get this Andis hair dryer. I have very thick, coarse, long hair (4 inches past my shoulders), and I'm transitioning from relaxer to natural. I have about 3-4 inches of new growth, and the rest is still relaxed, so straighter styles work for the time being. This hair dryer is EVERYTHING! Not only was it easy on the wallet, it gets my hair dry super quickly, while not sucking all of the moisture out of my hair. It takes less than 20 minutes to dry my hair, which is quicker than even my original blow dryer, and gets my roots pretty straight (I use the small tooth comb attachment). It's easy to hold and gets hot without burning my scalp. Coupled with my Sedu flat iron, my hair is almost salon quality, super soft and shiny! I would recommend this to anyone with the same hair texture as me. I am VERY pleased!"	2/17/2014

"I bought this blow dryer to replace a previous, different brand that was beginning to fail.  The wall-mount installation was extremely easy, since I was able to reuse the metal mounting plate from my previous blow dryer.  The base (i.e. wall-mounted) unit contains the ground fault circuit interrupter, so the cord itself looks just like a normal cord.  The length of the plug cord can be adjusted by winding it on the backside of the base unit before sliding the unit onto its mounting plate.  Drying is quick, and the only criticism I have for this appliance is that it is quite loud, especially on its Medium & High settings."	5/20/2014

A lot of people say they can get their hair dried faster with this - I haven't noticed that. That may be because I have pretty straight hair to begin with, and while I have a lot of it, the strands are pretty thin. The biggest cons is the button placement - fine when I'm taking my time, but when I rush, I ALWAYS hit the buttons.

"I am pleasantly surprised by my effortless shopping experience.  I was a bit leery after reading a few reviews where customers had a hard time contacting the seller or getting satisfaction after receiving defective items but I took a leap of faith since the complaints were few and ordered my dryer.  It came four days early!  Although it came in two separate boxes, installation was a snap even with the minimal directions that were included.  There is a slight burning smell when the dryer is first turned on, but like most new electrical appliances, it soon fades away.  This dryer gets very hot which I love.  I had to lower the thermostat after a few minutes.  The actual hood is larger than I expected and I did worry that it would be top heavy but so far I haven't had any problems.  My sister, who has locs, was impressed.  This dryer completely dried her hair in about 30 minutes and she usually has to sit for more than an hour to ensure that her hair is thoroughly dry."	7/27/2014

"I originally came onto Amazon to search for  a dryer that I had found in a store that was out of stock.  Once logging on, I decided to peruse the selection of hair dryers in the same price range.  This dryer had the largest number of reviews and the highest rating.  I was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking smooth.<br /><br />Other reviewers commented on how great the Onei dryer was, citing it's speed in drying, it's ionic component that left hair smooth, and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was.  The dryer arrived faster than anticipated and I was in love the first time I used it!!  It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers), my hair doesn't require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it's actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).  While I don't have to worry about waking anyone up, it's quiet enough not to drown out the phone ringing or my music playing while I get ready.<br /><br />The attachments are great...as is the long cord.

The color is a lovely medium shade of pink that is in a matte tone versus a plastic looking shiny one.  The dryer comes with a diffuser which works well for my curly hair.  It has an unusual type of soft touch finish.  It doesn't feel slippery at all.  It fits well in the hand and the finish seems to be it fit a little more snug that others I have had before.<br /><br />The air filter is removable and be sure to clean it about once a week.  I destroyed a blow dryer by not cleaning the filter - it overheats the motor and kills it pretty quickly.  Along with the diffuser, there is a very narrow concentrator attachment which works really well if you need to put heat on a precise spot.  There are three heat settings and two speeds.  There is also a cool shot button for getting the air cool quickly as you are styling.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this blow dryer (apart from the finish) is that it is much quieter than others I have had.  My first thought was that it meant that it wasn't as powerful but that is not the case.  It works well and is not as loud."	8/26/2015

I was very happy with the Andis, but I bought the Oster due to it being off-white instead of white which looks a little more high end. I also got the Oster because it had smaller footprint because I installed a new medicine cabinet and I needed a wall mount dryer that would fit in a smaller space. So far, I noticed that it has pretty good blowing power, but it doesn't run as hot as the Andis did, which may be better for my hair so it won't get too hot.<br /><br />The only issue with having a compact hair dryer vs. my previous full sized hair dryer is that the back fan is closer to my head. Because of this, when I held the dryer too close to my hair (which is long) and some hair got sucked into the fan in the back. I had to stop the dryer and untangle my hair from the fan.  This is no fault of Oster, I just have to get used to a shorter length of hair dryer! Just letting others know what to expect. So far I am pleased with the Oster.<br /><br />ETA: It is July 2014, and it hasn't even been a year that I've owned this dryer and my Oster has already died!

It comes in a box. My previous dryer was packed in a combination of cardboard and plastic which you open once and thats it. You have to throw the packaging and there is no placd to put the dryer back. But this dryer comes in a box and you can put back in the box.<br />The dryer comes with a control nozzle which helps you to focus on certain areas. I have very thick hair and I used to hate taking shower in the morning and drying afterwards. Because it used to take ne really long time to dry them. Now with Rimini dryer it takes me 10 mins and Im ready to go out. Especially in winter I get sick when I go out with wet hair. Rimini dryer has saved my life, time, and energy.<br /> This dryer is great for heavy, thick, long and even short and thin hair. Ut works great and helps you style your hair. Like my older conair dryer it has cold air button too. It has different levels of air pressure. The handle is great to grip on. My older dryer's handle got so greasy after few use.

I don't see why this dryer would be any worse than others.<br /><br />It IS stronger than my old dryer but I had to try them both back to back to convince myself, the difference is not dramatic. I like having two speeds and three temps that operate independently, so you can have high heat and low fan if you want, or vice versa. I've never had a cool temp before so I tried it, who knows, maybe that is why my hair feels especially nice.<br /><br />It's definitely heavier than the average cheap blow dryer but it did seem that my hair dried quicker so I think it's an OK trade-off. Also my old dryer's motor sounds pretty cheap and sick after the hum of this one, but I don't find much difference in loudness or tone.<br /><br />I like the rocker controls. The whole reason I bought a new dryer is that my really old dryer died, I had a spare hanging around the house that I started to use, but it has slider controls and I found it impossible to change settings without stopping and looking and even then it was hard to move the sliders.

This hairdryer Is 3 speed so the wiring Is more complicated than In the Vidal Sassoon. I have taken this hairdryer apart to clean and lubricate It, I take the back part off which has a metal screen Inside run In under the faucet with hot Water then I spray WD-40 In the motor doing that It will probably last forever. It has of get to burn out the fuse which I have bypassed a few times on the Vidal Sassoon but apparently there seems to be a piece  of plastic under to button to the switch which I lost taking It apart I put It back together and It worked right but had to use a small screw driver to turn In on and off with so I tried to modify It so that I did Not have to use a small screw driver now only high setting works. I have taken other hairdryers apart and could Not hardly put them back together this hairdryer goes back together fairly easy but It being 3 speed If You break some wires I do Not even want to think about It. I use hairdryers for many things as thawing out Water lines, defrosting the Freezer, defrosting the windshield on My Truck, pre heating the cab, dry out socks and shoes, putting under blanks when Its very cold this hairdryer has a round back which helps keep stuff from blocking off the Air flow and I have had hairdryers to burn out because of having a flat back and fall In to a chair with a blanket and burn out, and this hairdryer has a good automatic heat switch which prevents It from over heating but do Not ever leave a hairdryer under the blanket while You are sleeping or Not there."	12/16/2013

As others have said, the towel over the fresh air hole is needed in order to keep the steam in. I don't know why people complain about the air vent holes.  For 2 bucks you can buy a towel for them or for $2000 you can buy a different style of steam sauna.  Seriously folks, buy a towel.  Add a little aromatherapy salts and it is bliss!  Hard to find this kind of bliss for a mere 200 bucks. I get mine almost painfully hot in 30 mins then lower the temp, get in, and reset the timer.

It's still running great, and for the price, I think it's a great dryer. I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. During the time I've owned this dryer I've had hairstyles shorter than my ears and hairstyles all the way to my waist. The choices between hot, warm, cold, and high and low flow have made it versatile through all my haircuts. It's one of the fastest dryers I've used, and on high, the air has a strong, fast flow. On hot, it gets truly hot.  (But I've never had to worry about overheating.) The cold shot is cold.  My only dissatisfaction is with the claim that it's an ionic hairdryer. They must have put a tiny amount of ceramic or tourmaline into the unit to claim that it's ionic--it does not affect it's performance.  But other than that I've really appreciated it's reliability.  For the price, it's great."	12/9/2014

It contains all the elements I have in my older and much more expensive hair dryer.  It uses ionic ceramic toumaline to help reduce frizz and static that occurs from blow drying your hair.  It has three heat settings and two blower speeds.  I generally use the medium heat and the high blower, but I like to have the option to do a quicker dry with high heat when needed.  It also includes the cool shot button which allows you to quickly cool the dryer down in the midst of drying and styling.<br /><br />It has an easily removable filter, which is a huge plus.  I once ruined a dryer because I didn't realize I needed to clean the filter.  Now I periodically take the filter off and blow the &#34;wrong way&#34; through it to clear dust that accumulates through time.  I do this about one a week or so and it helps keep the dryer running well and from burning out.  I have placed a towel hook next to my bathroom sink and I hang the dryer on it.  It keeps it off the counter, saving room and keeping it within easy reach.<br /><br />The dryer comes with both a concentrator for when you are styling your hair or trying to focus the drying effort as well as a diffuser. The latter is important for me as my hair has a lot of wave and curl and blow drying it without the diffuser turns it all to frizz instead of curls.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it as a good and fairly inexpensive choice."	8/15/2015

At $200, this magnificent piece of equipment starting whistling at me within DAYS of using it. I went back to the store, and they kindly exchanged it. About one week later, it began whistling again. I went back to the store and they exchanged it for me. The third hairdryer I received didn't whistle until about a month of using it. Because this hairdryer got so many great reviews, I was willing to exchange it one more time, and so, I got my fourth hairdryer in 2008. It worked great up until about four days ago when I smelled something that smelled like it was burning. That alarmed me, but I ignored it. Then two days later, I heard something pop inside my hairdryer. After that, there was a piece of something rattling around inside of it! I finally had had enough, so today, I returned my hairdryer and got my money back. My husband did some research, and we found a great $35 hairdryer that works just as well, if not better, than the $200 piece of crap that I had to return multiple times."	1/10/2011

I was able to blow dry my hair with this dryer in about 15 minutes. That's a pretty good time for my hair. It typically takes 20 to 25 minutes to blow dry my hair. I like that this dryer has the cool shot button. I always use this button when I'm done to give my hair a cool down and to lock in my hairstyle. The dryer also comes with a button for 3 speeds and 3 heat settings. Another feature that comes in handy is the concentrator nozzle.

It is indeed heavier but at the same time slim, basically it is not a big hair dryer but it is heavier than your average ones, not a big deal but worth mentioning. It has two speed settings you can use and three different temperature settings.<br /><br />Bottom line, a very 'professional' hair dryer, better than the old Conair the wife will no longer use.

"I usually dread having to blow dry my hair as it is very long and pretty thick, so it would often take an hour or more to get it ALMOST all the way dry. Because of the time it takes to blow dry, and the fact I am semi lazy, I have had the same motel type dryer for about 15 years (YIKES) and been hesitant to buy a new one figuring they would ALL take forever to dry the mop on my head. When I was offered the Xtava, Allure 2200W hair dryer to review for an unbiased opinion I was pretty excited!<br /><br />This hairdryer is a decent size, yet very lightweight. It has 2 heat settings as well as the option for a cool blast here and there. There is also a detachable piece to put on it for when you want to dry your hair section by section to straighten it.<br /><br />After trying this the first time, I now want to use it every time I wash my hair! It is super easy to handle, which is awesome if you're all over the place flipping your hair around like I do. One of my favorite parts was that the back vent didn't try to eat my hair! My old one would suck it in if you got it within an inch of that vent, I am tendered headed, IT HURT!  ALL of my hair was dry, no slightly damp spots at all within 20 minutes.

Unfortunately, the concentrator has a tendency to get hair stuck in the space in between the concentrator and the barrel of the dryer, then pull hair out.  While it does dry pretty quickly, there isn't a noticeable difference in how shiny or voluminous it makes hair look.  It's also pretty loud.<br /><br />The buttons could use re-working as well, and would be better as switches, rather than buttons.  The temperature and speed buttons are prone to being switched on accidentally.  On the plus side, the hinged filter makes it easy to clean and the cord is a generous length (~8 feet).<br /><br />Overall, the John Frieda JF1 isn't an overly impressive hair dryer and I wouldn't recommend it for the price."	5/8/2012

It does a great job of drying my thick, coarse and frizzy hair in a short period of time and without as much frizz as other hair dryers, even my previous Conair. I was pleasantly surprised that it is quite lightweight. My major concern with it is that the finger control to turn it on and to high, low and off is very cheaply constructed and designed. My previous Conair dryer was easy to maneuver with my thumb but this has been redesigned to look sleek but not have enough gripping surface, especially when you have hair produce on your hands. I often find myself using my opposite hand to try to nudge it upward and have almost broken the control off with my (short) fingernail in the process. I much preferred the lever control of my old dryer and will be interested in seeing how well this control stands the test of time."	8/3/2014

It saw heavy use with waist length hair the three years prior. Even though it now costs almost half of what I paid for it, I still think it is a decent value. My Rusk 1900 watt ceramic dryer blows this dryer away, but it isn't fair to compare an $80 dryer to something that now costs $15. The amount of heat is pretty good and it gets my hair dry in an acceptable amount of time. The cold air button is really more of a less hot air than actual cold air, but I really don't have a use for cold air, anyway. After all these years, the cord is starting to bend oddly right at the plug, so I don't think it has a lot of life in it left unless I find a way to replace the cord.

"My old 1500 watt dryer gave up after 10 years of extreme use; I was working at that time so it got daily use and it was a super hairdryer. I looked for another one just like it but to no avail.  I found this 1600 watt one and since the low wattage in this style with the long barrel are difficult to find, I purchased 2. I no longer work outside the home and only use this every 2 days, (and my hair is shorter) SO I expected it to last longer than 9 months. Today when I turned on the unit and dried my hair all was okay but when I went to turn off the unit, the on/off switch locked up and then smoke came billowing out of that area. I quickly unplugged it and tossed it out the door should flames start coming out of the unit. Now I am apprehensive on using the second one I purchased. For 25.00 each, I would have expected it to last longer.<br /><br />As for drying my hair, it was a good hair dryer."	4/16/2014

It's just too much work done on my part!...and that's not the worst part    The dryer is CONSTANTLY COLLAPSING on my head!! Not once, not twice, but all the time I'm under the dryer.

Called the company back...and instead of just sending me a diffuser, they tell me that I have to send the whole thing back and that they will ship out a new older model. In other words, another 6 weeks without a hair dryer to get the diffuser that I need. So...by the time I purchase a new diffuser for $30 and pay the $55 for a replacement, I could just have bought a brand new RELIABLE chi or something. Don't buy the t3.

This thing gets hot fast without heating up the bathroom too much.

It also looks sleek and professional. I like that it comes with multiple attachments to give you the best blow dry you can get.<br /><br />I only have a few issues with this particular hair dryer. It blows really hard. Even on the slowest setting, the air blows out very forcefully. If I need precision drying, I have to use the diffuser attachment, otherwise my hair gets blown to smithereens. Another problem is the rocker switch design. When I'm using this, the rocker switch controls on the handle are very easy to push and I'm regularly having to reset my settings. After I while this gets very annoying.<br /><br />It seems to be lasting me pretty well. I've been using it almost one year and haven't had any trouble with its performance.

The heat distribution is not even as other reviewers have mentioned however I like that because it drys my scalp and roots without drying out the rest of my lock. It also works great for when I want to do a hot oil treatment or deep condition, I just throw on a shower cap put the heat on low and I am good to go w/o having to spend another 20-30 bux at the salon or waste water steaming up the bathroom. While I did have straight hair when I first received this as a gift I did not find it as convenient to use because my hair was so thin it would literally feel like it was burning my scalp.

Overall, I like it.<br />PROS:<br />*Dries long, thick hair very quickly (I have over shoulder length hair and it only took 10 minutes, great because I have a 10 month old who doesn't nap long)<br />*Cord keeper (no messing with wrapping up the cord)<br />*Three levels of heat, Three levels of speed, cold shot (Anyone can use it, although I never use the cold shot feature)<br />*Comes with concentrator & diffuser<br />*My hair was fairly frizz-free after use (the Ion technology)<br />*Decent price (I purchased for 29.99 @ Target)<br /><br />CONS:<br />*Fairly heavy (Not friendly for those who have difficulty lifting/manuevering/arthritis etc)<br />*The cord isn't that long (If you were trying to dry your child's hair, probably be a pain)<br /><br />So, hopefully it lasts long.

"The Mangroomer arrived a few weeks ago and 3 of us decided to give it a try.  Here's what we found:<br /><br />My husband has very short hair and only uses a hairdryer on occasion.  He thought the Mangroomer felt good and solid in his hands-light weight and dries his hair no different than any other hair dryer.<br /><br />My son used the Mangroomer for a few days.  He has longer hair (about 3 inches long), just over the ears.  He traded off between a smaller, cheaper hairdryer to the Mangroomer and thought it was less noisy than the cheaper, older model he is used too.  He thought the dryer was sleek looking, more manly than the girl hairdryer he has been using.  The different speeds and temperature settings were a plus considering he's never had the choice.<br /><br />Lastly myself, I have shoulder length hair that has a course texture.  I use a hairdryer every day.  The Mangroomer looks and feels manly.  In comparison to my 1 year old Remington hairdryer, the main handle is wider and less fitted to the hand.  The buttons do not get in the way in comparison to other hairdryers that place them front and center.  The buttons on the Mangroomer are on the side, which never seem to get in the way.  The Ion button is located on the side of the barrel with a cool blue button indicator.  With or without the Ionic button I felt the dryer was the same.  A huge plus to this hairdryer is the speed in which it dries your hair.  It pushes a lot of air to dry quickly.  Another important thing to note is in comparison to my hairdryer the air does not get as hot, personally I think this is why the hair feels softer and more manageable than when I use the other hairdryer.  I actually noticed a difference in the softness of my hair.  It seems absurd to think a hairdryer can do this but as a person who dries her hair daily, I won't be going back to the other hairdryer, even if this one is built bigger for a man."	2/25/2012

"I bought this dryer about a year ago at Target becuase I was looking for a dryer with a diffuser.  The first time I tried it, it was very difficult to turn on becuase of the flat switches, which are pretty stiff, and the texture they have on them doesn't help you grip them at all.  And it takes forever to dry your hair with it becuase it doesn't seem to get all that hot.  The folding handle and retractable cord work just fine, very nice for storage, and yes the cord doesn't really fully retract after the first time you use it, you're left with about 2 inches of cord sticking out.  I definitely would not recommend this hair dryer. The only reason I can't bring myself to throw it out is because it technically still works and I'll at least have some hair dryer in case my good one breaks."	5/18/2011

Not only does my hair dry before ten minutes pass, it comes out straight as a poker when I use the defuser. It's not too heavy and it's even snazzy looking. Just seeing it cheers me up.  Prince might prefer purple, but I love my little red corvette blow dryer..."	12/27/2011

It dries my long hair in no time and and it doesn't leave my hair frizzy. It is lightweigth and it looks nice. The chrome looking lint trap at the back can be twisted easily and pulled out for cleaning. It looks nice but be very careful because (correct me if I am wrong)  it is made out of a plastic material that seems like it will easily break. I am going to use and keep this hair dryer in the bedroom vanity just incase I drop it, it will fall on the carpet floor. The extra attachment that came with it is also nice. I also have a 1875w Conair infinity that I have been using for years. I love it but I compared the two today and they seem to blow about the same amount of air. If Allure is blowing harder, I cannot really tell. The small button to press cool air is a bit hard to press but truth is, I never use the cool air function anyway so it dont really matter for me. Over all, I will start using this Allure from now on and will give him hubby the Conair one.

It was founded in 1970 and then purchased by Colgate in 2006. Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom's alone to manage their business according to their original principles.<br /><br />Tom's makes natural products. The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring. By contrast, I looked at a tube of Colgate toothpaste that I have on the shelf. It contains flavor, whatever that is, saccharine, and propylene glycol. The last ingredient is a less-toxic form of anti-freeze. One advantage of Tom's toothpaste is that we do not have to worry about ingesting poisons when we use it.<br /><br />I have been using Tom's for years. The toothpaste comes in many flavors. On Amazon, you can find Peppermint, Spearmint, Fennel, Orange-Mango, Cinnamint, Wintermint, Apricot, Soothing Mint, True Mint, and Gingermint, among others. I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming. The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.<br /><br />I do not exactly live in a wilderness area, but my local stores no longer carry Tom's. Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites. The prices do vary from vendor to vendor, so check for the best price."	5/6/2010

As someone who regards his hair as stuff that sits on top of my head and needs to be kept in some semblance of tidiness, a grooming product is of little interest to me. I rarely use a hair dryer when I am away from home and it's very much a matter of if it's there I'll use it; if it isn't, then that's what a towel is for.<br /><br />The Mangroomer is a pleasant surprise. The bright red and black design is appealing -- clean, bold and well-shaped. It looks good and feels good. I liked the solid construction and the firmness of the controls. Most of the features go way beyond my needs. I still don't know what all the ionization stuff means; all I want to do is dry my hair quickly and have it feel good. The Mangroomer meets my basic needs in this regard.<br /><br />The slightly higher than average price doesn't seem to me to be excessive and the design makes it worth a few extra dollars. It is definitely more attractive than all the standard bathroom beige and blandness. I did not expect to actually enjoy a hair dryer.

Thank goodness I was nearly done blow drying my hair because I could only blow cold air unless I physically pried the button back up.

I absolutely HATE spending money on something that blows hot air. I will buy expensive shampoo and hair products, but I just can't spend the money on a dryer. With that being said, I love this hair dryer! I normally keep my hair wrapped in a towel and then blow dry after I've applied my make up. Today I decided to blow dry before applying my make up, and it took me 3 minutes and 28 seconds to go from soaking wet to dry. Obviously not everyone will have the same results. I have fine hair and it is rather long, it hangs about 2 inches past my bra strap in the back. If you have thicker hair, it will probably require a longer dry time. It really does cut down on my hair drying time. I went from around 15-20 minutes to 3 minutes and 28 seconds.<br /><br />As far as the construction of the actual dryer. Eh. It feels very cheap. I'm curious to see if it will last more than a few months."	10/11/2013

Perhaps they have to make the outlet diameter larger than others so the wind pressure isn't too great on the head and hair. This thing isn't slim but not too big nor too heavy. My just turn teen daughter like it and find it not too big or heavy.<br /><br />From out many broken hair dryers ceramic is certainly heat more even than non-ceramic ones. But since we mainly use it to dry rather than style, I'm not sure fancy ceramic is really better than ceramic. There is only one rocker button for cool / turbo. The other buttons are large slide buttons so you can't accidentally change the settings. The finish is quality hard glossy plastic. I will not buy non-slip rubbery finishes again as they degenerate in no time.<br /><br />So far so good for a couple of months.

Aren't they all the same?  Well, as is true with many things, all hair dryers are not created equal, and this was a GREAT find.  It seems a simple thing -- just turn it on and dry the hair -- but I've been frustrated many times with hair dryers that are too strong, blowing like a hurricane no matter what the setting, too weak, barely putting out a cough of air, or too cold, or too hot, or that just fry themselves after a few months of use.  And, specifically, I wanted a travel hair dryer, since my last supposed &#34;dual voltage&#34; hair dryer went up in smoke (literally!) when trying to use it on the other voltage setting.  So, this hair dryer has been a welcome treat.  Not only does it do as it claims, in being dual voltage, but you still got low and high settings, and the great &#34;cool shot&#34; at either voltage setting.  Air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that -- less heat and air, or more heat and air -- and are noticeable in difference.  Comes with two attachments, as shown, handle folds, plus the back opens up for cleaning!  I have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices, let alone at the great price for this one!  If you're looking for a great hair dryer that also can travel the world with you, this one is the one!"	10/30/2013

They say 100Volts on them. Look at all your other hair dyers and electrical appliances. They usually say 120V or 125V.<br /><br />I've copied and pasted this from a blog where someone asked if you can use Japanese appliances in the U.S.: &#34;Can you use Japanse appliances in the US?<br />I am an electrical engineer. My expert opinion is I would stay away from using any appliance that generates heat...such as a hairdryer (as previously mentioned) or a kotatsu or a boiler for tea water...unless you know what you are doing!!<br /><br />Japan's electrical system is roughly the same as the US's. However, the US's voltage is 120Vac RMS (60Hz)while Japan's is 100Vac RMS (50 or 60Hz depending on region).<br /><br />So, any heat generating device from Japan that is used in the US will get 20% hotter than it's design intended. The risk is damage to the device and/or fire...or injury of a person. Please be careful!!<br /><br />That being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them. But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you'd need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.&#34;<br /><br />We do have another of these dryers that's a slightly different model that hasn't sparked, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy another.<br /><br />I've put a link below to a similar dryer that's Conair brand that we've bought before and which is what I'm replacing this unit with. There may be other brands; just look for hair straightening dryer or something like that.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ME2YWG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"	5/20/2015

Although I liked it when it worked, the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute. And then yesterday when I turned it on, it sounded like it was going to explode. I really wanted this to last so much longer. Guess it's going in the electronic recycling bin.<br /><br />Sept 2015 Review: I've had this dryer for a year now and it's held up amazingly! The attachment I use is still attached and works great, and has never fallen off.<br />My only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now and I have to set it down after a few minutes. I have thick, wavy hair so it takes a little time to dry. Also, the handle (where my thumb holds the dryer) is starting the wear and there's a worn section. I'm still using this dryer, despite the handle getting over heated.<br /><br />Aug 2014 Review: Great dryer, good price, good overall! Nice long cord, drys much faster than my last 2 dryers. I love all the attachments and the fact they don't fall off when you use them. I have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten. Don't rely on all the reviews of &#34;too heavy&#34;, &#34;buttons wrong location&#34;, &#34;too loud&#34;, etc... Purchase and use, judge for yourself.

Hair dressers could comment more on the differences between dryers.  I'm not too picky about it as long as it isn't uncomfortable to use and works well. This one is just fine for me.  I'd recommend."	8/7/2015

The manufacturer wants me to ship it back to them....and then they'll send me a new one in 10 days.  How am I supposed to live without a hairdryer for that long?!?!?!

It is a powerful hair dryer, and yes, it is loud-but it has a low setting if that bothers you.<br /><br />I don't see what the hype is about this dryer being really heavy as I've read all over the reviews; it's not light but certainly not weighing my arm down either. It cuts my drying time literally in half, so who cares? The 'cool shot' button works really well which was also a huge plus for me. This dryer has a cartridge that is very easy to remove hair from so that it won't fail as easily. Overall, it's a solid product and I've been very happy with mine.<br /><br />Side Note: Conair will replace within four years if this breaks if you call them, which sealed the deal for me for a $30 dryer. I called and asked Conair about this directly before I purchased mine through Amazon. It doesn't matter it's through a third party."	4/15/2014

The dryer worked great for 3 months. Then, the motor went out. The honeymoon was over. The box states it has a 24 month manufacturers warranty. They will replace, but it costs money. For me it was $40 plus another $15 to ship. Absurd! They said even doing so was against their rules because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. Well, long story short, the manufacturer (T3) wanted $55 to replace. Amazon, knowing this is a poor business practice, stood behind their service and refunded the entire purchase price. To summarize, I wouldn't buy anything this manufacturer peddles and I hope you don't either."	4/2/2013

"I have very thick, very curly hair that typically takes a LONG time to dry. The little mini-hair-driers that you find in most hotels these days just won't do the job for me and none of them have a diffuser or will fit a travel-diffuser attachment (which us curly-girls require). But with this hair-drier, I found the answer!!! It has GREAT air-power, 2 heat settings, and dual voltage so you can take it on overseas trips as well. Barely adds any weight to your luggage (so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non-carry-on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit) and the handle folds up for compact packing. The diffuser attachment works quite well -- maybe not quite as effective as my full-size diffuser with my full-size drier, but pretty darned good. It's great for travel and will have your tresses looking gorgeous in no time. Highly recommended!"	1/29/2015

Not until you go to $100+, and when your comparing a 100$ hair dryer to a 20$ one, the 20$ one is the hairdryer to go with.  Update: retractable cord doesn't always fully retract. Still works fine.

But surprisingly, my hair feels smoother and more conditioned than normal (as if I used extra conditioner or just done a treatment). The dryer dries quickly with strong blast without being too noisy. It looks sleek and, despite the size, doesn't feel overly heavy. The weight is well balanced. The cold blast feature works as expected. The issues I had was with the sliding button controls which can be a little stiff. Also, I have straight, moderately thick hair and the 'conditioning' effect sometimes flatten my hair. Hair can feel too soft that there's not enough 'lift' and bounce. This is great when hair is brittle and frizzy. Not so great on humid days. Curly hair may not have this issue. So far, the biggest drawback is definitely the price."	12/3/2014

I live in a townhouse so I would prefer a quiet one over a powerful one, so it works great for me. It is also really convenient having it hang on the wall. Hanging it up was a little annoying, primarily because a screwdriver that uses bits is too wide to fit in the holes, but once I borrowed a regular screwdriver from work it went okay. I would say the high on this dryer is a little more powerful than the low on a regular one, but it still only takes me about 3-4 minutes to dry my waist long thin hair."	9/12/2014

One was a Conair with ceramics in the wind tunnel and ionizer. The other was an older BayBliss hair dryer, also with ceramics but no advertized ionizing properties. I didn't use a towel at all for the tests because I figured, if it works as advertized, the Panasonic should dry out my skin less well too. It seems to work.<br /><br />All three are very good hair dryers. I think the Panasonic did the best job of not fizzing up my hair and leaving it feeling very nice. HOWEVER, it stinks! It smelled like I was blowing melted plastic all around the room. That is not the case when I use either the Conair or the BayBliss. Additionally, while both the others are premium models, neither cost more than $50.<br /><br />I'm going to let the Panasonic air out for a month or so outdoors in the sun. Maybe some of the plastic stink will outgas and it will be a great hair dryer. Many people aren't as sensitive as I am to these plastic odors. If you love that new car smell, especially the smell of mostly plastic interiors after they have baked in the sun with the windows up, you'll love the smell of the Panasonic. I can't stand the smell of Fabreze or Bounce but maybe you think they're wonderful. If so, you'll think this dryer is to die for.<br /><br />I think they have the makings of a very good product. That nanoe technology seems to work. However, I'm concerned that each of those tiny little water droplets is surrounded by plastic particles, making it all the easier to find its way to my lungs. Hopefully, airing out will do the trick but I would still recommend a redesign to keep the hot air away from plastic parts.<br /><br />Addendum: I initially gave the product 5 stars but upon reflection I have decided there is no excuse for putting out a product that runs hot air directly past plastic when companies have been making hair dryers with metal or ceramic coated nozzles for years. Yes, recycling water vapor is a great idea, but don't forget to use the best of older technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.<br /><br />Update: Because of the smell, I gave the hair dryer away.... to my barber. He uses it frequently and likes it. After more than a year, the bad plastic smell is almost gone.der technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.

"My experiences with this hairdryer and this company are X4.  I purchased two sets of two hair dryers for my daughters for Christmas.  Each set had a travel size and a full size hair dryer.  They were $200.+  for each set.  At the time I made this purchase, reviews were pretty good and the warranty for each  hair dryer was for 4 years.  Within 6 months, both travel size dryers were no longer working.  They smelled of burning wires, and were VERY HOT!  The company REFUSED to replace them, saying they no longer made this particular model.  Before the end of the 1st year, one of the regular size dryers had gone bad as well(same hot, burning smell), and the other before 15 months was up.  Comapny wouldn't return a phone call or answer an email.  I tried many times for 3 months, finally giving up and calling the seller (QVC).  I really didn't expect them to do anything after 15 months, ( and they didn't), but I wanted to warn them about the company not standing behind the warranty that they used in their sales pitch.  They are still selling them, so this warning is for potential buyers from anywhere.  DON'T BUY T3 brand products!!!"	2/21/2012

"I used to have a Babyliss (Conair's high-end line) and it started giving me problems roughly 4 weeks into having it.

I have curly hair, so I use both attachments and are happy with their performance. Another great thing about this product is that I can feel safe that the intake side won't suck up my long hair and result in unfortunate hair loss. The mesh is good quality and in a tight configuration. The intake is also very easy to ope/close, which makes it easy to clean out any dust that may accumulate overtime.

I wanted to wait to give any reviews till I used this for awhile and I must say that it hasn't scored any points for length of use. I thought maybe if I continued to use it, my hair would improve from being dry, but it hasn't.<br /><br />This dryer has a low and high speed setting, and low, medium and hot heat settings. The low setting dryed my hair as fast as a cheaper dryer and the high speed setting is probably enough to even dry clothes rather quickly! It packs a punch! After using all three heat settings, I found that medium works best although hot doesn't get as hot as most other dryers I've tried and those tend to actually burn the hair. There's also a cool shot feature that works great if you're using the hot setting and want an instant cool down.<br /><br />The attachments are an Airflow diffuser and an Airflow concentrator. Both of these work well if you either want a wide spread airflow or a concentrated one. The concentrated one works good if you're using either a brush or curlers and want the air concentrated on that particular spot. The wide spread one is simply if you want a wider area of airflow, such as if you have really long hair.<br /><br />I thought that the tourmaline feature would make it somehow better for my hair, but I haven't noticed any improvement over other standard (and less expensive) hair dryers. This is my biggest dissapointment with this one and why I waited over 3 months to submit a review.<br /><br />On the plus side, the filter hasn't clogged yet or gotten any hair in it at all! This is amazing, since with other dryers I've used, it didn't take long at all before hair would start gathering in the filter. This one also has a removable filter, but as of yet I haven't needed to clean it.<br /><br />This is also heavier than most dryers, so if you have weak arms or otherwise have trouble holding something rather heavy for the length of time that it would take to dry your hair, this one probably isn't for you. However, if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms, this will do it! It weighs under a pound, but compared to other dryers, it weighs about 1/3 more on average. This is also quieter than most dryers I've used. More time will tell on how durable it is, but the way this is constructed, I have no doubts that it will last a long time.<br /><br />I'm giving this 3 stars due to the good features it has, but for the cost of the money and the seemingly better for your hair impressions that it seems it should have, it didn't score there. It remains just above average.you. However, if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms, this will do it!

"This dryer takes a very long time to dry my fine, wavy, chin length hair (20 minutes or more). I think the problem is weak airflow. Also, the styling nozzle keeps falling off, which is really annoying. I've had this dryer only six months, and am already investing in a new dryer of a different brand.  I thought the problem was my hair until I blow dried my own hair at my salon with my stylist's dryer, and it came out shiny and beautiful in so much less time. Since I use the same brush and product as her, I know it must be the dryer. For an inexpensive dryer, I preferred the Andis. I am paying a little more for my next dryer which is supposed to be of better quality."	6/4/2013

I don't find the sound level much different from other hair dryers as some have complained. I appreciate all of the different settings (3 heat settings, Hi/Med/Low power, and teh different Wattage rankings). The concentrater actually stays on the dryer, which is not what I have experienced in the past. Also, the cord retraction is not perfect; it sometimes  leaves an extra 6 inches out, but I actually find it better than other cord retraction models. Since it is a full size blow dryer, I don't expect it to be compact and the additional cord is a non-issue for me. Glad I happened upon this model."	3/17/2015

My daughter also has a authentic T3 and when she came to visit, she used my new one.  She immediately knew something was wrong with it and in fact got really angry because it dryed her hair so slowly she was late going out that night.

"I bought this product yesterday, and took it out of the box for a test run. Immediately, I liked the color and how light it was. I really wanted to love this dryer, I promise.<br /><br />So, I get it out of the box and unwrap it. Comes with a set of instructions and an individually wrapped concentrator. Never really use those, but cool, okay. I attach the concentrator to the blowdryer, and plug it in - not near any kind of water whatsoever, I assure you.<br /><br />I let it blow out air for a few seconds and adjusted the heat. No lie, literally TEN SECONDS after it was turned on, the blow dryer turned an intense red color. I thought it was just a gimmicky effect, but NO -- the heat was spreading quickly toward the handle and it became unbearable to hold due to the heat within miliseconds. I quickly shut it off, only to see SPARKS FLYING OUT OF THE DRYER. FOR A GOOD FIVE SECONDS.<br /><br />Okay, maybe I did something wrong. Maybe it was a fluke. I take off the concentrator just for good luck, and plug it in again. The thing roars to life, becoming red, and starts to shoot out sparks again almost immediately. A few unfortunate strands of my hair are caught in the frenzy of it all, and are singed.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I didn't wait until I actually had to DRY MY HAIR to test this item out -- who knows what would've happened if the dryer were closer to my hair????<br /><br />I thought I got a lemon of a product, but a quick google search proved me otherwise -- check the one-star ratings here, and you'll know what I'm talking about.

However while inspecting this item it has scuff marks on the &#34;concentrator&#34; as if it had been used before or before being shipped. Not sure if it will lessen in terms of the force of the air over a period of time but we'll see. Also at the back of the dryer there was a removable backing that allows for cleaning if the air vent gets clog, which I didn't expect and it was a pleasant supprise. The &#34;concentrator&#34; also takes quite a bit of strength to put on.

Great if you want a short, retractable cord, but definitely heavy"	"This is the 2nd or 3rd Conair I've owned, and I've found them all to be durable, well-constructed appliances. This hairdryer--maybe even more than the previous model--leaves my hair especially smooth and sleek. It dries hair quickly, and the concentrator attachment really works well so that you can put the dryer right next to your brush. My two complaints are related to the retractable cord function: 1) The dryer is heavier than a usual dryer because of the cord reel, and 2) The cord is not very long, maybe only 3&#34;. Neither of these things may be a problem for you. If you specifically WANT a retractable cord, the extra weight is worth it, otherwise, it's just extra weight. And if you don't need a long cord, if your outlet is right next to your mirror for instance, the short cord is no big deal. But just keep these things in mind"	5/20/2013

Needless to say, its color, size, sound and portability mattered. I chose this and couldn't be happier. He loves it too. The heat of both settings is ideal, it worked well for my hair too. The fact that it is dual voltage was not as important to me, although we travel to Europe a lot, but I can use the dryers in the hotel itself. It does sound a little louder than I had thought after reading reviews that it was quiet. The other issue is that the slider switch is a little difficult to operate and tends to slide all the way from end to end. It is difficult to move to the off position in the center."	10/26/2013

"The product itself is a 4 - 5 star product. It is just right for my wife's needs and the night light is a welcome plus. The 3 stars was for installation. I found the wall stud to screw the back plate into the wall for security. I drilled the holes. Then pulled out the included screws and to my surprise found out that the holes were way too small for the screws to fit through. I had to go to the shop and drill out the holes bigger. This took several trips as I wanted to make sure they weren't too big so the small screw head would just go through the hole. Very frustrating and oh, so avoidable by the company. Once installed, the plate makes it easy to get the product on and off the wall. I hope it is fixed in the future.

It's the tiniest dryer I've ever seen!!!  It almost fits in the palm of my hand.  Folded, it's 4-5 inches long (not counting the cord).  I've been using it for about a week now just to test it out before my trip abroad and it's surprisingly very strong.  No weird smells as someone else mentioned- maybe their particular product has an issue.  So far mine is working great.  My hair is shorter so I'm not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  I'm done in minutes.  The other great thing is that it has &#34;dual voltage.&#34;  I had to read up on this because I haven't traveled in a while and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made dual voltage today- so check your product and educate yourself.  Just look at this hair dryer, for example, and it will say 125V / 250V on the handle.  This means it will work anywhere where the voltage falls in that range... most if not all of the world. BUT YOU WILL NEED AN ADAPTER when going abroad with this.  So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too... you DON'T need a converter (more expensive) for anything that's dual voltage,  just an adapter.  The adapter is just the little plug part that goes into the wall so you can plug it in.  The converter is usually bigger and box-like and more expensive.  It converts the voltage. You can find adapters for just a few bucks.  Some dual voltage products have a little switch you have to bother with and it's dangerous if you forget to change that switch... no switch and no worries with this hair dryer!!  Just Google dual voltage and you can read up on it, and the difference between converter and adapter.  All these things are helpful to know when traveling abroad.  I love this thing... best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  Read my updates below.  12/20/12 Update:  This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  When I turned it on high it was like a crazy loud rocket ship and I thought it would take off or start fire- it was frightening!!!!  Yes, I did use my adapter, and it's possible it behaved this way because of the junkie old remote house with questionable wiring I was living in. Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country's modern capital and it wouldn't plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  Yes, it was the right plug shape and I have no idea what that was about, again, the randomness is possibly the result of the house and the country I was in.  Who knows.  But I couldn't use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn't good.  I will continue to use it here at home in the USA where it works perfect.  Maybe better for local travel and still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  I am still highly recommending this product for travel, but taking it abroad may be questionable.  1/15/13 UPDATE:  I barely started using it back home a month and the dang thing started making crazy noises and I thought it would explode or catch fire.  It basically went dead.  I tossed it in the garbage.  I am now changing my 3 star rating to 1 star.  I was wrong.  Turns out this was a piece of unreliable junk and potentially dangerous unreliable junk after all... didn't even last me a year.  And I barely used it!!!  Not fit for my traveling adventures."	6/28/2012

I needed to purchase a new one quickly, saw this one in a local store, and picked it up.<br /><br />This dryer has several very nice features.  First, it has three HEAT settings (hot, warm, cool) PLUS two STRENGTH settings (low and high).  In addition, you have the option of boost the air flow with the turbo button and also using the cool shot button to set your style.  I have found that what works best for me is to mostly dry my hair on the high heat-high power setting, then go down to the low power for a minute or two of styling.  Using this method, I am able to complete my overall drying time significantly more quickly than with my old hair dryer.  This dryer's nozzle is a bit longer than that of my old dryer, meaning that I bumped my head the first few times I used it, but I quickly got used to this.  For a larger dryer, I find it to be relatively lightweight and relatively quiet as well.<br /><br />Another feature of this dryer is the removable back to allow you to clean the lint screen; although I was attracted to this concept, I am unable to get the back off!  Perhaps we just have a dud, but it simply does not move.  Also, I should mention that the attachment is HUGE.  I hadn't really planned on using it anyway, but when I did try to snap it on to the dryer, I could not get it on easily.<br /><br />Overall, I have have been quite happy with this hair dryer--I just wish the back would come off.  My final rating is 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Edited 4/1/13:  Good news--I was able to get the back off this morning!  It seems like it just suddenly came unstuck when I tried it again (after many tries).  I was able to clean the filter and put the back back on, and now it comes off easily with a slight turn clockwise.  Still very happy with this hair dryer!"	2/18/2013

The removable filter is a simple plastic screen that screws off of the back so it can be washed.  It's nothing special, but it's a nice touch that you can remove it vs. trying to get all the gunk out while wrangling the rest of the dryer.

Without thinking, I went out and bought a second one since the first one lasted so long, and thought maybe the sparking incident was a fluke.  This morning, the same thing happened to me while using it. It sparked and and there was a pop - again I turned it off and unplugged it immediately.

This blow dryer is one of the best available at major retailers today. When I went shopping for a new blow dryer, this one actually looked sturdier than its bulkier, more expensive Conair cousins, with their breakable diffusers and fragile-looking reset buttons. The d5000's compact size makes it easy to hold, and it won't take up much space on on your bathroom counter when you're done with it. Although it's touted as a travel dryer, I find that it makes a great daily styling tool, drying my damp hair in just a few minutes (Caveat: I have fine, medium length hair, so someone with longer or thicker hair might need something more heavy duty).<br /><br />My only complaint about this dryer is that it's kind of loud. Granted, it is still an improvement over my old Sunbeam blow dryer, which sounded like demons being released from the bowels of Hell when I turned it on. With the Remington, I find that wearing earplugs reduces the noise to an acceptable level. With that said, I do have sensitive hearing, so a normal person may not have a problem with the noise.<br /><br />If this hair dryer lasts as long as my last one, which I owned for about five years, then I will be satisfied."	9/12/2010

"First of all, this blow dryer is extremely light.  Surprisingly light even. If you have long hair (or a lot of it), that is something you will surely appreciate.  It also has a very powerful motor so that you can get the job done in no time at all.  If you are like me at all you need to get your hair dry as fast as possible in the morning so you can get on with your day.  And not 'frizzy' dry as many blow dryers are good at accomplishing....but sleek and sexy dry.  The diffuser nozzle of this product makes that possible for me.  It stays on securely while drying my hair and diffuses the air just enough that my hair no longer 'frizzies' up.<br /><br />Some tips on using the diffuser:<br />1: apply your choice of hair products<br />2: allow your hair to dry 75% before using the diffuser (if you are in a rush, use regular blow dryer first without nozzle)<br />3: use clips if you want to add volume at the crown of your head<br />4: if you have time, use the cool setting to dry your hair with the diffuser.  If not enough time, use medium to ensure your hair will not frizz<br /><br />I am truly honored that I was offered the opportunity to review this product at no cost to me.  Every once in a while you just know you have a winner on your hands, and this is such a product.  Stylish, effective, fun and extremely light.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*product received free or at a discount in exchange for my review"	2/20/2015

Now, this may just have been one bad unit out of thousands sold. And the company rapidly replaced it, which is good. Not so good is that they did not send me a return label, so I paid to ship it.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I would rate this a pretty good dryer. It is reasonably quiet, and it is rated at 1600 watts, so it does not participate in the Hair Dryer Arms Race at all stores, where it is impossible to find a lower-wattage dryer that will not blow fuses (surprising more people don't complain about that). I would not want to rate it down for burning out. But six months is not reasonable, and this is an appliance that works in the home in a bathroom, which means it should be beyond any danger.<br /><br />Use your discretion, and keep watch to see if more people report this problem. I suppose a report to the CPSC might be in order, just to get a data set."	11/5/2013

This lasted for about 10 seconds and then sparks shot out about 6 inches from the handle and it died.  I threw the dryer down and yanked the cord out of the wall.  WTF?  That was crazy.

"Thought I was the only weirdo that struggled to dry her hair w/in 45mins.<br /><br />Recently found out my best friend is the same & she (like me) was convinced there was no way around it.  Writing this review b/c there's probably more of us out there.  And you 100% aren't stuck.<br /><br />I've got long, thin hair - but a lot of it.  It traps moisture & it's naturally wavy, so it always took me 30-45mins to tame it dry.  Most of the time, a solid 45mins.  Result was hit or miss.  Since I have to wash my hair every other day, breaking point comes when you don't want to wash your hair b/c you don't want to deal with the drying time & tired arms (...and I'm strong).<br /><br />Bought this on a whim during a Gilt Group sale, when my generic (probably Conair) dryer was on the out.<br /><br />Now I dry my hair in 10-15mins.  Usually, a bankable 10mins.  On a bad hair day, 15mins.<br /><br />No, seriously.<br /><br />On top of that pile of awesome, it's very light & evenly weighted.  Buttons are intuitive & don't get accidently knocked on/off while you use it.  Results are always the same.  Doesn't damage my hair w. heat (probably b/c it takes so little time).  And it's small enough that it's an easy travel companion.<br /><br />Don't get scared off by this dryer's price - it's a life saver.  And game changer.  Delay getting this if you want to waste your time.<br /><br />For the Holy Trifecta: this hairdryer, a boar bristle roller brush, & Shu Uemura White Tea Polishing Milk.<br /><br />This dryer & a boar bristle brush easily tames my hair w. little effort & leaves it looking silky smooth.  Every time.  (Note: choose a brush that has both natural boar bristles & taller plastic bristles w. the knob-like, non-scratchy tip - needs a decent amount of boar bristles, but few enough to let air through easily. It doesn't have to be expensive, just needs to fit those parameters.)  For doubled ease, get Shu's White Tea Polishing Milk.  A little goes a long way.  You'll be a happyaddict.  Rub some in your hands & pat it from middle of your hair to the ends, but particularly the ends to give them a little tangle protection.  It helps smooth my hair even faster & it lets my hair better tackle humidity - friends have commented that I look normal when they feel they don't.  PS - The brush & Shu isn't a hack - the dryer is.  The 3 together is trifecta.<br /><br />I was ecstatic to find this - I'd always struggled just to tame my stubborn hair.  Now I actually feel in control of it.  Just bought a replacement for my 3/4yr old original & also bought one for my mom as an xmas present. My friend's now a convert & begging for the name of my dryer.<br /><br />You won't regret."	1/26/2015

My wife loves this hairdryer and uses it all the time too. It pumps out plenty of heat on the highest setting. There are numerous options for temperature settings. I've never needed it, but I tried the cold air blast feature. This apparently sets your hair after it has been styled? I don't really understand that process, but if that's important to you - the feature does just what it says. I found that the hairdryer volume while running is pretty acceptable (not sure if I'm alone on this, but I hate really loud hair dryers). The design is attractive and I guess a little manlier than the standard hairdryer? I don't know, grasping for reasons why this is a mangroomer specifically, but yeah it looks pretty cool and not feminine. But I think you'd have to be pretty insecure to be weirded out using a feminine hairdryer anyway. I think the Negative Ion stuff is hogwash, but hey I'm not a hair scientist. Bottom line: this hairdryer makes wet hair dry."	2/16/2012

I won't buy a dryer without high/med/low heat and high/low speed which this one has, because I do my hair both curly and straight.  I like that it comes with a concentrator and diffuser, because it is sometimes hard to fit aftermarket attachments.  The filter is easy to remove and clean It also isn't too heavy.  The color is cute, although I don't know if most men would like it.<br /><br />On using it, it has good power, and it's not too noisy.  It also doesn't get hot anywhere but on the very tip by the metal grate, and even that's not bad.  If you are a stylist who likes to hold the barrel of the dryer, this is totally doable.  And it's cool enough to put away immediately after use instead of leaving it to cool, which is especially nice.  The cord is a good length.<br /><br />The retractable cord is definitely a nice feature, but should be done two-handed, guiding the cord so it doesn't come up and hit your hand or arm (I tried it, OUCH!).  It's a tad tricky because the button is small and slightly awkward to get to one-handed.<br /><br />All that said, I have two issues with this product.  The first is minor... there is no loop or hook to hang the thing up!  I keep my dryer on a hook inside the door or my bathroom vanity cabinet, and it's an annoyance that I can't hang this there.  And because the cord is retractable, you can't really loop it around the barrel and hang it with that without negating that feature.<br /><br />The second issue is more significant.  I am no engineer, but in my lay opinion, this dryer has WAY too much vibration.  It gives my hand a bit of a workout while holding it.  I can't say whether this is a problem will this model, or just for some reason the one that I was sent.  But it is significant, and it is still happening after 10 or so uses.<br /><br />This dryer is nice, but without understanding specifically the benefits of ionic, tourmaline etc., I don't see anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  Personally, I'd rather have one with a hanging loop.e anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.

Making it pretty much usable with any plug in our bathroom vanity. When you turn it on, you notice how quiet it is compared to your past hair dryers. Comes in handy when your spouse may be sleeping in while you get ready in the morning. How well does it work? Longer, thicker hair seems to dry much faster and with it's lightweight use, it is much easier to sustain longer positions when drying thicker hair. The three temperature settings are nice and really easy to get to with one hand. With the retractable cord, ease of use and the lightweight features of this, I can highly recommend it."	12/9/2014

My deciding variable in a hair dryer is does it blow-dry with power or is it somewhat lacking in this area (I've had my share of the low power models and I am quite picky here). Verdict: it's plenty powerful and allows for a quick exit out the door every morning.<br /><br />***Update*** As of today 10-21-16 I officially lay to rest this device. Honestly, It has been used 24/7/365 for just about 2.5 years which for me qualifies as a resounding endorsement of the product (at the time I paid $11).

"This is a great little dryer, it dried my thick curly hair straight in 10 mins and it came out smooth and shiny however, I was surprised at how heavy this little dryer is! The weight of this dryer was just a bit too much for me and it bothered me in only 10 mins of use and I'm not exactly a weakling. The Sedu Revolution Green 3600 hair dryer actually dried my hair in close to half the time(6 mins!) as this one even though the watts are a little lower, it seems just as powerful if not more and it looked just as good! Also, the Sedu Green dryer seems MUCH lighter to me and slightly less loud which made it much more enjoyable to use. The 4000 is a great powerful little dryer but I am IN LOVE with the Sedu Green 3600 dryer and recommend that dryer over this one."	4/11/2010

And then it broke.  :(	"I bought this hair dryer from Target 4 months ago because it had the best reviews of all the ones they had there on the shelf.  In my house, we only use the hair dryer around 3 times a week total between my husband and myself (I only have to style my hair once every 4 days or so)... so this thing got minimal use.  When I bought it I was annoyed at how the temperature switch (to go from hot to cold) is in a spot on the handle where you usually grip the thing while you're drying.  I would constantly accidentally switch it to the cold setting.  And, I never felt like this got hot enough to style my thick, unruly hair.  My hair is crazy thick and I need a lot of heat to get the frizz out while I'm drying and styling... but I've had to deal with this and hair dryers not being hot enough my whole life, so this wasn't a huge surprise.  But then, a few days ago the heat function just completely broke.  So, now it only blows cool air no matter what.. which makes it basically useless to me.  I suppose that for $25 I got my use out of it for 4 months... but I hate that I'm having to send another plastic piece of trash to the landfill a lot sooner than expected.  :("	11/29/2012

As always Amazon.com shipping is superior! Ive never had issues with an items sold from amazon.com although I have with their third party sellers. I thought this was a safe bet. I attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire!!! I was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that I use for chargers and other items with no issue! It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped. I was sooo scared! luckily I wasn't burned but my blanket had to be tossed! Amazon.com was helpful with processing a return and I still think revlon products are great but something must have been wrong with this particular one so be careful with this!	2/28/2013

I felt like I'd tried about every hair dryer (affordable) in the store. I decided I'd try an expensive salon one to see if that'd do the trick. So I splurged and bought the Buttercup Dry Bar hair dryer. It worked well but only cut my drying time down about 5 minutes and in all honesty, I didn't think it was worth the $200. I came across the John Frieda hair dryer and read some good reviews so decided I'd give it a shot, plus it was much more affordable than the Dry Bar. Well, I loved it! It only took me 11 minutes to blow dry this mane of mine plus it gave it extra shine and my ends don't look so dry. It also straightened out my hair better than any other hair dryer I've had which cut down my flat iron time, as well. The only cons are that the buttons are placed in an odd location and it has a weird hum but you get used to that real quick, so it didn't really bother me all that much.

Using this higher setting gives you only one setting option - low.  But the power over there is so strong that it feels more like high.  Even high though isn't that powerful, but gets the job done for basic drying purposes - probably not any fancy styles.  Make sure to set it to high with a screwdriver before you go- I had a heck of a time finding an object equivalent to a flat head screwdriver.<br /><br />In the States, this hair dryer isn't really worth using.  &#34;Low&#34; is like someone blowing out their birthday cake candles and high is like...well...not much more than that.  I will use this as my travel blow dryer only."	2/8/2014

"I read all of the other reviews for this iron and thought it would be great.  I have used a Chi for about 8 years now (both the wide and the regular 1).  This iron did not compare to the Chi.  Even on a high heat setting, although it straightened my hair it did not get rid of all of the frizz like the Chi does.  Also, I only have to pass over my hair 2 times with the Chi, whereas with this iron I had to go over it 4 times or more and still did not get the same results.    This iron was also a lot more difficult (despite other reviews) to glide through the hair compared to the Chi, so it took a lot longer to do my hair with it between more passes and slower gliding.  This iron was no better than a discount store bought $40 iron to me.  Very disappointed!"	2/26/2011

I have to say this one makes even that one look wimpy.  I cannot believe how fast it dried my hair.  Right out of the shower and it was only about 4 minutes for my thick hair to be completely dry and cooled.  This hair dryer is a little hefty compared to others but I think it is easier to handle than my other Xtava.  Also even though the hottest setting is quite hot the hair dryer itself only heats up at the end.  You can hold the barrel if you need to maneuver it.<br /><br />The power was unexpected.  My hair did tangle slightly but it was no big deal considering how much more volume I gained.  Even after brushing my hair it isn't flat.  My hair is smoother than usual as if I had flat ironed it.  The hot is hot and the cold is cold as if you had air conditioning for your head.  So, you don't have to spend extra time cooling after drying.  It was a matter of seconds after drying to having perfect cool hair.  The extra power of this dryer may have a learning curve.  I actually had to figure out where I had wet hair because I'm used to having still damp hair.  Anywhere I pointed it for a few seconds resulted in dry sections of hair.  That's how good this dryer is."	2/25/2015

This one came up with the most reviews in this price range. I know I shouldn't but I wash and dry my hair every day. I needed something reliable but under $30.<br /><br />The first thing that bothered me was that I received an obvious return which doesn't bode well. I've tried this for a couple days so the jury's still out but right away here's what I like and don't like about it:<br /><br />PROS<br />-very quiet<br />-lightweight<br />-useful attachments<br />-multiple speed options<br />-cool shot<br />-ability to clean filter<br /><br />CONS<br />-nozzle is longer<br />-matte finish makes it slippery to hold<br />-cool shot button is much shorter than older Conair<br />-easy to accidentally press/hold cool shot when you don't want it<br />-speed/heat button sliders very cheaply made<br />-filter is hinged and doesn't open all the way<br /><br />For price and value, okay buy. If you have short arms like I do, the longer barrel makes for an awkward morning ritual. Also, since it's slippery to hold, you have to learn how to hold it differently which can be problem, if like me, you have arthritis issues. With the old Conair, I could lazily hold it however I want. I could rest my thumb below the cool shot button since it protruded at least 1/2&#34; and you really had to push it down to use it. The cool shot on this one is flimsy and depresses quite easily. I'm also worried about the settings buttons. It does not seem very secure and/or there is only a small attachment in the middle. In other words, as you slide them, the top and bottom of the buttons are not attached in any way to the unit. They actually stick out a little bit (are not completely flushed against the handle). Whether this will be a problem should they come off remains to be seen.<br /><br />Overall a mixed bag but it was priced fairly cheap. Will update rating if it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I'm already drying it out by repeated washings).f it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I'm already drying it out by repeated washings)."	12/2/2014

I'm very happy to have purchased it as it has changed the texture of my hair tremendously. I never knew how much a blow dryer can have such an effect to the results of your hair. My hair is so smooth, soft, and shiny. I use to dread blow drying my hair and instead forfeited it altogether. I would only blow dry on special occasions and preferred air drying because I have very long and thick hair so it would take my full hair to dry 30-45 minutes and even then there would be spots still damp, my hair would get caught in the vent, it was EXTREMELY hot under the blow dryer....basically it was more of a hassle to blow dry my hair. With the T3 it is so pleasant and 10 times quicker to dry. I love the efficiency and ease the T3 provides as well as the amazing results.<br /><br />I had my mother try my dryer out so she could feel the difference and she was instantly converted. She commented she never knew that a blow dryer could make such a difference. [We are use to buying cheaper dryers because we didn't think a more expensive dryer made a difference.] This is a great investment and what a deal you get from purchasing on Amazon. I see the T3 dryers on sale at TJ Maxx periodically but it is still no way near the deal I got on Amazon. Right away I bought one for my mother [per her request] and we can gladly say we have never looked back!"	4/5/2013

It seemed to have the ingredients for a great little wall-mounted dryer. However, the dryer keeps shutting itself off (motor just stops blowing) when I dry my hair for more than 3-4 minutes.

I used the average of 4 stars to keep the rating unchanged.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE that a lot of these hair dryers do nothing more than mechanically lock out the on-off switch from using the HI TEMP setting WHEN set for 220 volt input for foreign countries.  That is very typical.<br /><br />PLEASE ALSO NOTE that the Low Heat mode at 220 volts does not work the same as 110 volts.  From an electrical point of reference, doubling the voltage yields a four fold increase in power (wattage).  If the Low Heat mode at 110 volts (USA value) is 400 watts, then using this dryer in Low Heat mode at 220 volts (eg, Europe) would generate 1600 watts.  That's the way the power equation works.  That's how my current unit worked when we vacationed in Europe.  Low Heat mode at 220 volts generates high heat and a fast fan speed.<br /><br />WHAT you lose is the low power curling and shaping mode when using these dryers at 220 volts.  There is no 400 watt option in the 220 volt setting.<br /><br />If you want both HIGH and LOW Heat modes, buy a transformer to convert 220 to 110 volts (and be sure it is big enough, power wise, to handle the 110 volt High Heat wattage).  The cost, beyond the purchase price of the transformer, is the added transformer weight in your travel luggage.<br /><br />I hope this clarifies how these type hair dryers work in Europe....  a retired Electrical Engineer.<br /><br />PS:  Going from USA 60 Hertz (a.k.a. 60 cycles) to European 50 Hertz makes no difference for this appliance.<br /><br />PPS: None of the 220 V countries use our 110 V two prong or three prong wall plug.  Even if you don't buy the transformer,<br />  you will need a plug converter kit to plug this hair dryer into the 220 V wall outlet (found with the luggage in most department stores or on<br />  Amazon under Plug Converter - but be sure to get the 220 to 110 version and not the 110 to 220 for Europeans visiting USA)."	3/2/2011

My hair doesn't dry any more quickly even though the thing is easily twice as large and has ion technology.  Also, my old travel dryer easily got hotter than this one.  The wind power isn't as strong, either, even on the highest setting.  I kind of like this because my hair doesn't blow everywhere when I'm using my round brush.

It is solidly constructed, has three (not two) temperatures.  The little door on the back for clearing the filter is hinged rather than detachable.  It is nicely balanced in the hand.  It comes with the usual attachments, which I don't use so can't judge.<br /><br />It dried my short hair in about 15 seconds.  It dried my visiting sister's long curly hair in about half the time she says it usually takes her.  This is partly attributable to the 1875 watt motor, but I've had another 1875-watt dryer that was less powerful.<br /><br />The virtues come with two possible vices - this thing is heavy, and it doesn't have a retractable cord.  Only the first is a problem for me, as retractable cords add yet more weight and the storage area for them unbalances the dryer in use.<br /><br />Of course it is on the expensive side.  You can get a cheapo hairdryer for $15 or a good one for $30 - $35.  You'll have to decide whether the quality and the features are worth the extra cost.  This one will last longer than your $15 jobbie, and it really does a better faster job.

"I was very interested in trying this dryer; it features all the current blow dryer buzzwords - tourmaline, titanium and ceramic - all or severely guaranteed to calm the frizz for people with hair like mine.    My hair is thick, with a wave, and it absolutely mushrooms after blowdrying or in high humidity. It takes forever to dry my hair, so naturally your weary arms tick up the heat factor to get it DRY already, and that in turn ups the frizz factor.    I must say, I was impressed. The dryer features several heat and style settings, so to give an honest portrayal of the results, I kept the heat on the equivalent settings as my usual blow dryer. Then, after a while when my arms would usually get tired, I increased the volume setting.    Unfortunately, with this blow dryer, I wasn't faking the exhaustion in my arms. This isn't the heaviest blow dryer I've ever used, but it's up there! If there was such a thing as getting muscled from using blow dryers, I'd be Ahnold already. I wasn't faking it when I reached the point in the blow drying when my arms were saying, Enough already!    The dryer is more than enough power to accomplish the job. What was interesting was after my hair was dry, it really WAS less frizzy than the same routine done with my usual blower dryer.    The second time I tried it, it was raining out and about a billion percent humidity, the perfect laboratory for determining if all the tourmaline/titanium/ceramic add-ons actually worked to keep hair smooth.    It kind of did. What I can say was my hair frizzed, but it frizzed LESS, and it was much shinier than I've ever seen my hair in humid weather. I guess that's an endorsement, but not enough of one where one might forgo a flat iron to flatten out the kinks.     The dryer comes with a diffuser, which I've always found to be WAY too much work and time (if your arms hurt with regular blow drying, you'll be crippled when you're done using a diffuser on thick hair!)    If you're in the market for a blow dryer, and you have a problem with the frizzes, you might want to give the Remington serious consideration. It did a nice job for me, but the gold standard - not having to use a flat iron - remains elusive, even with this dryer."	5/14/2009

Normally it takes me a good 40 minutes to get my hair mostly dry and I air dry the rest with quite a bit of frizz. This little hair dryer is very lightweight, comfortable to hold and dried my hair nearly complete after just 5 minutes with no frizz. I returned it.<br /><br />The problem is, this is literally the loudest hair dryer I have ever come across. Really loud. I felt like I had hearing issues for about 15 minutes afterward. Granted I have severe migraines and am super sensitive to noise. I love the job it did, I just wish it did it more quietly. I could not imaging turning this on while traveling, camping, staying at someone's house. Too bad"	6/2/2015

I would give the product 5 stars except you can't turn off the night light.  I've mounted it inside a cabinet where I can shut the door but otherwise would have to put ugly black tape over the light.  With so many studies showing that light disrupts healthy sleep, one would think that manufacturers would stop putting night lights on everything, or at least offer the option to turn it off.

"Like many, this was purchased because of the experience I have had with Andis clippers.  They have lasted 7 years plus.  This was great, at first.  After a few months use the power started gradually getting lower and lower.  Now it barely produces enough air to blow a tissue.  It is less than a year old so I contacted Andis about sending it in for repair.  I have yet to hear back.  Their website points you to the repair facilities in your area.  One problem, they only service Andis clipper products.  It makes me doubt whether Andis even makes these or just slaps their name on it.  If I don't get a response from Andis, I will take this apart and see if there is another manufacturers name inside.<br /><br />Update-Still no response, so I called again.  I was told they do not service hair dryers, they simply replace them.  So I am returning it, at my cost, for a replacement.<br /><br />New Update-Received my NEW replacement.

I was very happy with this hair dryer and therefore expected the same results from a newer hot tools hair dryer.<br />However -  the thermostat setting is too too hot..  I cannot use it at all on high  setting and barely on the middle setting -  I have  managed to &#34;get the job done&#34; by starting on the middle setting as long as I can stand it and then switching to the cool setting  and then manually pulling  the bonnet to a peak over my curlers.  My Model 30001 had five heat settings.<br /><br />In addition to this the new dryer is very nosy - almost has a whistle to it.  The bonnet is heavier and not as flexible.<br />In short - I am not happy with the new dryer - do you have another model with more heat settings?<br /><br />A problem with both models -  the hose easily becomes detached from the bonnet while in the process of drying.	2/25/2013

There's absolutely no reason for the prongs on the plug to heat to the point that they become a branding iron. I let the plug cool down and checked it in another outlet to be sure the problem lay in the dryer and not in the electrical outlet, and the prongs heated to the point of burning in under a minute.

Seems sturdier than other brands.  Dries hair quickly.  Noise is per a normal hair dryer.  Heat and air velocity both normal.<br />I went through 3 or 4 of a competing model that would last only 1-2 years and then burn out.  I had just been replacing them because the new dryer would fit into the old wall mount, but decided not to keep shelling out money for an inferior product that did not last.<br />Bought a different competing model but it started making a high pitched sound after 2 days, and did not get hot enough to efficiently dry hair so it was returned.<br />Finally bought this one.  It is not as aesthetically pleasing as competing models, but not quite as ugly as the photo makes it seem.  The dryer is white and gray (wish it were all white), but the gray is a normal gray, not the greenish color that it looks like in the listing.  The wall mount does not install flush to the wall, as others have mentioned, but it is close enough.  I quickly got used to turning it on and off at the wall mount - it not the annoyance I anticipated.  In addition, if you put it in the wall mount while it is on, it automatically turns off, which is kind of convenient.  The best part of this dryer is that you can open the back and clean the fan blades.  I suspect build up of lint on the blades is what eventually caused the other dryers to burn out, and with the other dryers it is not possible to access the blades (at least not easily).  Thus, I expect this dryer to last longer.  There is also a &#34;hidden&#34; setting where you can turn the power up, and I did that when it first arrived."	2/26/2015

I explained that hair dryers can't simply be plugged into an adapter. You need a complicated, often expensive, voltage converter that can handle the power draw of a high wattage appliance.<br /><br />I figured for the price of a converter we could likely just find a 220v hair dryer and then rather than carry her giant hair dryer, AND a bulky converter, we'd just have one compact device.<br /><br />As it turns out, we stayed in several hotels, and ALL OF THEM had hair dryers in them. We didn't need to bring anything at all. Moreover, this one is pretty weak, and the ones in the hotels tended to be much better.<br /><br />So my advice is this: if you're going to Europe, don't bother buying and packing a hair dryer. Just use the one in the hotel. And if you should happen to find yourself in a hotel that doesn't have one, you can probably buy something better than this one for about the same money while you're there, and you'll have saved yourself the hassle of packing it."	1/24/2014

I purchased about 3 weeks ago and have used it almost every other day since I bought it.  It dries extremely fast in the morning so it allows me to not have to blow dry which is essential with African American hair and relaxers to prevent dryness. The settings are great and It is super quiet which is what I was looking for.  Those are all definite positives.  However, I would have to agree with one of the other reviewers.  It is extremely top heavy and I had the same problem in that yesterday it fell over and the visor in the front broke.  Now I am hoping I can find someone that replaces the part as the part is screwed in and if that is the case then this would possibly increase my score a little but you still have the problem of it falling over in the future.  If I cannot find a part to replace it online then I would drop this review to a 2 or 1 since it doesn't work as well without the visor keeping the heat in."	4/11/2015

The first unit lasted about two years which I thought was a bit short but it was convenient, worked well and seemed worth a second try. Maybe the one I got just was not a good one. Our use was far from excessive. It was mounted in a master bath where only my wife and I used it. We both have short hair.<br />The second unit I purchased had an additional issue. Though the price was about the same, the cord from the unit base to the wall outlet was significantly shorter than on the first. I guess they saved a few bucks by providing a shorter outlet cord (now about 2-3 fee)t. I accommodated this though the wall setup did not look as tidy as the first unit as I did not have a long enough cord to reach the outlet. The bigger concern is that 2 years later it stopped functioning again.<br />Rather than buy another wall mounted unit, I bought an aluminum generic hair dryer wall mount http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FS0EFLM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and purchased an inexpensive hair dryer than I can easily replace in the future as the need arises."	3/22/2015

It has 4 settings: cold, high, low, off which are pretty self-explanatory. Seriously, any newbie can operate this. Now I wake up with perfectly set hair because I'm able to dry and semi-style it in the evening before I go to sleep, with a little argan or sweet almond oil on my scalp as a heat protectant.<br /><br />People have complained that the 'cool' setting is not cool enough, but I actually like that.

The hair dryer is light, was very easy to operate and try different hair styles with especially since it includes both a diffuser and a concentrator. I tried at least 10 different hair styles with this thing and found it super easy to adjust and operate.  Feature I love the most: adjustable heat setting.

"[[VIDEOID:e5ff7a1f6cf2306e1ed10662c3a2720f]]My hair is so thick it used to take me almost 30 minutes to dry it even with the use of a hair dryer, until I used this professional ionic hair dryer! I love the precision the concentrator nozzle provides; allowing me to focus the heat exactly where I need it the most. This allows my hair to dry much faster since all the air is going directly where the hair is still wet. The nozzle is easy to attach just by pushing it on the hair dryer when it is powered OFF.<br /><br />The hair dryer has (2) speed settings and (3) heat settings, so if my niece wanted to use this she could *she has really thin hair so she doesn't need a high setting, or much heat*...I love the cold shot button, I use a big round brush to give a little curl on my bangs..I hold the brush in place; use the heat to give a shine and volume to my bangs and then I do a cold shot for a minute to lock in the look, sometimes adding a little hair spray before I use the cold shot..it works perfectly!<br /><br />I love the hook being attached to the hair dryer so I can hang it up when I am not using it..less clutter on my bathroom sink! This hair dryer is well made and absolutely my favorite one I have ever used. The cord is thick and sturdy which is great because it will not break as easily. I was provided a sample for evaluation and review."	2/15/2015

I love that this dryer has a diffuser attachment. Most hair dryers only come with the concentrator attachment. My curls, which have really improved since quitting straightening,now take forever to dry, since my hair is not dried out, anymore. I can use this on my curls to dry them quickly, since I hate leaving the house with wet hair. The diffuser works well, not frizzing my hair at all and my curls are bouncier than when they air dry. That's a great plus. I only need about 5 minutes of drying time to achieve 95% dry hair. It has a cool shot and also a high/low feature. This dryer gets very hot, so I dry my curls on the medium setting, which is still hot. The higher setting would be better for straightening."	8/3/2015

Powerful blower in that little motor. However, after we ordered what we thought was the same through Amazon, it turned out that the color is not the only thing different on this unit from the black one by Conair. This unit is louder and feels cheeper. I recommend the black unit that looks identical to this one except that the cooling button is on the back side of the unit. The only number I could find on the black unit was D167S - that may be an older version of the Conair &#34;Folding Handle&#34; dryer on the Conair website - Model: 124TL.

I went to pull the diffuser off to go back to the drying piece, the blow-dryer completely  fell apart. I noticed that the blow-dryer is made out of card board inside- THAT IS SO DANGEROUS!! I tried to get a refund from the 3rd party vendor and they replied by saying &#34;throw away the item, we will mail out a replacement!&#34; I wrote back and demanded my money!! I never heard back from them so AMAZON luckily refunded my money. For a dryer that is over 100$, this is ridiculous.<br /><br />My mistake was to not read the reviews.

I've used wall-mounted hairdryers in hotels and thought that it would be the solution for me.    Wrong!  While it's great to have it up on the wall and out of the way, the small size makes it better suited to short hair.  With longer hair you have to be careful to hold the dryer farther away from your head so that hair doesn't get sucked into the back of it.  I believe this is what caused my hairdryer to start overheating after just two months of use.  The fan became very sluggish and the coils would overheat, then it would spark and the thermostat would reset.  The fan would speed up within a few minutes to where it could keep the coils from overheating, but eventually this took even longer.  I took it apart to clean it but it is made in such a way that you can't get at the hair that is wrapped around the fan stem.  I could see that it was only a few strands anyway, but even this was too much.    Even when it was new it didn't blow a lot of air, though it did get fairly hot.  I'm off to buy a full size hairdryer with more power and will just have to figure out a place to hang it.  Blah.      p.s.  The nightlight is really, really bright.  I disabled mine after a couple of nights of trying to ignore the green glow emanating from the bathroom."	1/17/2009

"First of all, I must say that I am a huge Nexxus fan. I am aware of, and I have tried better products, but I owe Nexxus for making my dream of having silky long hair a reality. Being racially mixed have many advantages, but sometimes those combinations come out a bit wacky...to make the story short, my hair is silky soft, but very, very curly and the result is crazy breakage. It was very hard for me to grow my hair. Until my beautician started treating my hair with Therappe shampoo, Emergencee and Humectress. She would trim my ends every 6 weeks and in less than a year my hair had reached past my shoulders and a few months later it reached almost the middle of my back. This may not sound like much, but for someone who could never grow her hair longer than a short bob right under the ears this is HUGE.

Step AWAY from this product	"Before I make a purchase I generally like to read the reviews, but I do take them with grain of salt. Everyone has their own opinion, and let's face it we're not all going to agree. I actually have never felt so strongly about a product that I felt the need to write a review. That is until now. I can't stress enough how disappointed I am in this dryer. I work hard for my money so I thought long and hard before forking out $[...] for a dryer 11 months ago. When it first arrived I loved it. It did what it said it would, it dried my hair faster, it was quiet and lightweight. My friends made fun of me for spending so much, but I have thick hair and I thought of it as an investment. I purchased it on February 8, 2008. Today is January 27, 2009 and my dryer is BROKEN. It overheats and sparks. This dryer had normal use (5 or 6x/week). [...].     As if I'm going to give them any more of my hard earned money. No thank you Bespoke labs. I will say that investing in a good dryer is worth it. Ask any hair stylist. My friend bought a Chi for about the same money, (maybe less) I tried it, and frankly I preferred it. It dried my hair even faster than the T3. For those of you who have and enjoy your T3s, I understand, I did too for 11 months. For those of you considering buying one, I would STRONGLY discourage it."	1/26/2009

"I've only had this for about a week but I'm pretty impressed so far.  I had my old hairdryer for at least 6 years and it finally crapped out on me - it was just a Revlon that I had gotten from Walmart or somewhere.  I considered spending about $30 more on a nicer dryer, but decided I'd try a Conair first since it was cheaper and my mom has one that I love using when I go home.  So I ordered this guy (which came in two days - gotta love Amazon Prime when you don't have a working hair dryer) and was initially kind of bummed when I opened it.  I know you get what you pay for, but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has, so I was worried it wouldn't work as well.  Turns out my fears were unfounded - this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer, and the tourmaline ceramic technology, which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz, totally works!  My hair has been amazing every day.  I also really like how light it is now that I know it works.  I don't know how long this guy will last and I can see the matte casing eventually peeling off like the other reviewer mentioned, but it's functionality is fantastic for the price.  Would definitely recommend this."	12/11/2013

Good blow and not too hot means hair dries faster with less damage. With good technique can leave hair silky soft. Not as defrizzing as my Volare though. And it feels heavier to me. So my Volare will remain my baby. It is better than the Elchim 2001, the $300 T3,  $200 CHI and an FHI dryer that I tried. I have super long wavy hair, live in the Bay Area, and I don't get haircuts often enough, so I need the anti-frizz.

My hair comes out shiny and, with the diffuser that is included, I can maintain the curls and waves that are natural to my hair.  The nozzle can be set for precision when drying and there is a cool shot button in case the air feels too hot.  Three temperature settings make this dryer versatile and useful for wet or damp hair.  There is also a quick-dry nozzle attachment that disperses air throughout the head and makes drying very quick.  I would only recommend this if you are in a  rush because I found my hair duller looking when I used this attachment.  However, there are days when a quick dry comes in very handy.  The hair dryer's description says that it utilizes ions in the air to maintain moisture in your hair.  Whatever method it uses, it really works and is the nicest dryer I've ever had."	11/19/2014

"I am very surprised to be writing a raving review about a hair dryer.  I never really gave much thought to my hair dryer and the potential damage it could do to my hair.  My last dryer (it was either a Clairol or Revlon-I threw it out after it starting throwing sparks) left my hair extremely dry after approximately two years' use.  I kept switching shampoos and conditioners, thinking that my hair was just changing and I needed to find a new product.  Turns out all I had to do was buy a new hair dryer!  Before purchasing this dryer, I read a few online articles that suggested a lower wattage dryer for fine hair.  That is basically how I ended up with this dryer-it was the lowest wattage dryer (besides a travel dryer) for a reasonable price.  I have only been using it for a few weeks now and the difference in the feel of my hair has been unbelievable - extremely soft!  In addition, the dryer is surprisingly quiet and dries my full head of hair in less time than my prior dryer.  Overall, I recommend this product."	11/7/2014

The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was it's weight. It's quite heavy, and much heavier than my last two blow dryers. I don't know if I'll get tired of holding something heavier, but I am hoping that it's an indication of quality.<br /><br />I do like the three heat settings, two air speeds and the cool shot of air, which can be used while drying. It is quieter than my last dryer, which was a Conair with the same wattage. The dryer is a little awkward to hold, however, and I had trouble changing heat and speed while holding it midair and drying my hair. It did dry my hair faster but not by much. I used both attachments to see how they work and diffuser worked like it should - giving curl without the frizz. I had trouble getting the concentrator attachment on the end, and then it blew off the dryer both times that I used it. I don't know if mine just doesn't fit well, but that was a little annoying.<br /><br />It may seem like I'm being knitpicky in this review, but I'm just trying to cover all the bases for a blow dryer. After saying all that, it does what it's supposed to do - dry my hair. If it lasts longer than my last two blow dryers, then I'll be really happy."	10/7/2013

"I rarely write reviews, but I am beginning to try to find time to go back and voice feedback on the items I use most in my household. I bought this to replace my old Ionic 1875, which was on it's last legs from years of hard work. I am wishing that  I had bought a different dryer. The high setting is SO strong, and the medium would take a while to heat up to hot if I just started there. I can deal with this, but what I hate is the 'cool' touch button, which is supposed to hold your style and reduce frizzies. My last dryer did a great job with this feature, making my hair look smooth and shiny. But on this dryer, pushing this button is like going into a wind tunnel. Why would the makers kick the cool setting up to super-dooper-strong like the high setting? It blows your style to prices after you have just spent the time to create it!

"If I am to be honest, I have NEVER found a hair dryer that I truly loved.  I have VERY think and VERY long hair, so finding a dryer that lives up to the task is hard to find.  My hair dryer runs for a good 30 minutes straight which means #1. By the time I get through drying my hair I am sweating due to the heat needed to accomplish this task and #2. My arms are really tired by the time I'm done. Which brings me to the 2 things I absolutely LOVED about this hair dryer.<br /><br />*It didn't take 30 minutes to dry my hair. It took about 15 and my face never felt the heat from the dryer. I'm not exactly sure how this happens, but I found myself on several occasions actually reaching my hand up in front of the dryer to make sure it was blowing hot. It was. All I felt was a cool breeze on my face while my hair took the brunt of the heat.<br />*Even though it looks really heavy (I kind of freaked out at it's size when I pulled it out of the box) it's actually quite light and balanced, so it doesn't put a lot of stress on your arm while you are styling your hair.<br /><br />Now... here are the features that I loved.<br /><br />*It has 3 different speeds & temps allowing you to mix and match according to your hair type. (these are toggle switches)<br />*It has a locking cold button so you don't have to struggle while setting your style & holding down a button at the same time<br />*It came with 3 different attachments, 2 directionals and a diffuser<br />*The ion actually made my hair shiny, so much so that I DIDN'T need to use my flat iron when I was done drying my hair.<br /><br />Overall quality product. A little pricey, but well worth the money if you have difficult/think/hard to manage hair."	7/28/2011

However, I used it one more time and the breakers blew and the dryer stopped working all together. The dryer lasted exactly three days.

I never used any of the attachments so I can't comment on those, but the blow dryer itself worked great. What finally broke was actually the cord it seems.

No, it doesn't and maybe I should complain about that.  But seriously, it's....a....hair dryer.  The one thing I can see is that if you were used to a hair dryer that just blew hot air, you might think this dryer makes your hair flatter.  It doesn't cook your cuticle so your hair does lay flatter and ultimately, feels softer.  But less damage is worth it--you can always adjust your products or hair style.

I figured, why drop much $ on this if they all are mediocre?  And indeed I am glad I did not spend much on this one.  It does have strong airflow for such a tiny dryer, which is great for non-curly purposes.  But the diffuser does not slow down the air flow very much, and on top of that, the diffuser is SO TINY -- no more than 3 inches in diameter.  The low setting does not generate quite enough heat, but the high setting has too much air flow. I end up switching between low and high to build up some more heat, and only stick the diffuser into the roots of my hair so it doesn't totally blow out all the curls.<br /><br />So if you are picky about drying your curly hair with a diffuser, this probably isn't the travel dryer for you.  If you just want to give your curly hair a head start on air-drying because you will be somewhere cold, it's probably fine for that purpose.  Might be OK if you have very strong tight curls that don't get blown out as easily.  Or maybe you can get crafty and block some of the holes in the diffuser...<br /><br />The dryer did overheat a few times when using it on 220V with an adapter in Europe, but I think as long as you are conscious about not using it on high setting for too long, it should be OK."	9/23/2013

It was light and didn't tire my arm or wrist, it got hot enough to dry my hair, and it wasn't extremely loud like a lot of dryers are. However, after a month and a half of using it once every day for about 15 mins, it stopped blowing hot air. It still blew air and everything perfectly, it just stopped heating the air. So, I had to get rid of it because cold air does not work well to dry my long hair.

However, it burnt out within a year, possibly because I dropped it, but this time I didn't want to spend too much cash to replace it and that one is no longer available.  FYI--The one I had and bought on Amazon was:  Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black<br /><br />I selected this one because I was so pleased with the last one.<br /><br />The color and functionality of this dryer are it's best features.  It probably makes a better &#34;travel&#34; dryer than anything.  It doesn't allow you to adjust the temp (cool, warm, hot), but it does have a cold shot button.  You can only choose High or Low speeds.  I totally missed those details in the online description that before my purchase.  I did watch the video and it is what sold me, but the video makes this dryer look more powerful than it really is.  Perhaps if you don't have thick hair like me it would perform more to my liking.<br /><br />In my opinion, I don't think it is even close to salon performance.  It says it uses ion technology, but my last Conair that was labeled ionic worked so much better and dried my hair faster with hardly any frizz.  This gets the job done, It dries my hair pretty fast, but my hair is very frizzy after which annoys me.  I will probably take the plunge and buy a higher-end hair dryer in the future, until then, this is OK and will get me through!"	11/5/2014

"My previous Conair blow dryer had a retractable cord and I loved it.  It was great for easy storage and my storage space is limited and cramped.  After years though, that blow dryer died and I needed to replace it.  I always go with Conair because they make a trusty, yet inexpensive, product.  I chose this one because of the retractable cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage.  I figured that if the retracting cord helped with storage, the folding handle has to be even better, right?  Plus, I'm traveling internationally this year, so I thought the folding handle would be good for a suitcase and the dual voltage would be good for international power conversion.  While I had high hopes for his blow dryer, it has really been nothing but disappointing...<br /><br />The blow dryer itself works great, like any other Conair I've owned.  The retracting cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage switch, however, do not.  The joint on the folding handle is quite flimsy.  The top of the blow dryer wobbles a bit back and forth and I'm sure this will only get worse over time.  This feature doesn't seem built to last.  The retractable cord also doesn't retract.  It gets stuck halfway through and still leaves about a foot and a half of cord sticking out of the end of the blow dryer.  It's not a huge deal since the blow dryer still works, but it is definitely irritating since I bought the blow dryer specifically for this feature.  I don't know for sure, but in my opinion, I think the retractable cord doesn't work right because of the folding handle.  It just seems like that whole area is made flimsy and I think the cord is getting stuck inside the blow dryer near the joint of the handle.  And finally, the dual voltage switch--I can't, for the life of me, get that thing to switch over.  I've tried using my acrylic nails, a screwdriver, my boyfriend, etc. and nothing has worked.  Unless you're traveling with Thor, I wouldn't count on this feature.  Luckily I have a power converter for other electric items, so I can use that with the blow dryer...if it makes it that long.  I may chuck the thing out a window next week!<br /><br />If anybody is interested in the Conair blow dryer I had prior to this one, it was the Conair YOU Cord Reel 2-in-1 Hair Dryer.  It last me years and the retractable cord worked great!"	3/13/2014

"Excellent hair dryer with some good features.  Some of these features seem to be from a marketer's mind rather than real.  It won't fix damaged hair...whatever that means.  It won't make your hair shinier, healthier, or improve your already good looks.  However, in real world day-to-day use it is very capable and effective at drying and styling.<br /><br />It feels solid and well built without being too hefty.  It has very solid cord connectors and circuit breaker protection built into the plug...excellent safety features!  The handle and controls are very well placed for ease of use.  They stay cool to the touch during use.  It has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings.  Low speed and low heat works best for us. It puts out a huge amount of hot air at high heat and high speed.  It has a cool air blow feature which is good for finishing the drying process.  It has a couple of attachments, a concentrator and diffuser, which you may find useful.  It definitely is not portable though it is transportable if weight is not an issue.<br /><br />Hair dryers are a commodity and there are a lot of choices.  This unit stands out in a crowded field and should work for almost all hair drying and styling situations and requirements."	8/19/2015

It did in fact dry my hair faster than my old Revlon. I have long thick wavy hair and I could tell within a minute that it wasn't going to take long to get it dry.  I actually bought this at Target because my other dryer had stopped working and I couldn't wait a few days for a new one to be shipped to me. I went with the intention on getting a different one but I got to hold them both in my hand and I really liked the way this one felt. The handle is sort of slanted back, which sounds awkward but it feels more balanced this way. It also doesn't have that annoying high pitched whining sound that accompanies most dryers. I also like that there is a cold shot switch that you don't have to hold in. It stays on cold shot until you switch it off. The sliding power switch isn't difficult to slide. The tension is just right in that you're not going to accidentally switch it off constantly during use, nor will you have a hard time getting it to move.  I am very happy so far with my purchase but if anything out of the ordinary happens, I'll be sure to update my review."	2/10/2012

So it's a pleasure for humans as well, with no piercing whine.<br /><br />This is my first ceramic styling tool, and I've found that my hair is silky without frizz and quickly dried every time, so ceramic really does make a difference. This is a sturdy, sleek dryer, with great heat, power, and cool blast button for setting your style.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't rank this dryer a 5 star, is because of the placement/design of the setting buttons.

I'm glad I didn't spend more because this one gets the job done and you can keep some cash in your pocket. I have thick hair and if I were to let it air dry, it would have this ugly frizzy wave to it. I love that this hair dryer came with a concentrator and diffuser. I use the hair dryer by itself first and just finger through my hair with the setting on high speed and high heat to just get the excess water out and then throw on the concentrator and low dry with my ionic brush. I'm literally amazed at how fast I can dry my hair with this thing and I'm kicking myself for not getting one sooner."	3/11/2013

I used to turn the unit off to shut off the bright night light.  But the button is like screwed up - maybe its just mine but its not easy to use anyway.<br /><br />The night light is WAY too bright for one.  It's like having a small table lamp on, so way to much to be called a night light.<br /><br />Also, the mounting is different.  You install a plate first, then screw the unit onto the plate.  It was hard for me to do compared to the other Andis unit I got and then after a while it started to come loose.<br /><br />If I had to guess, Andis purchased this product from some other company and slapped their name on it.

The new unit came with a novel night-light feature, which failed immediately, leaving an unpleasant smell of burnt plastic and an oily black soot deposit on the handle. The hair dryer still ran, but it filled my hair with the smell of an electrical fire. I sent it back to Amazon who promptly replaced it. The night light on the second unit again immediately failed, although without the odor of the other one. I'm still using it and I really like the hair dryer, but it appears to me that the night light is just not ready for prime time and may actually constitute a fire hazard."	1/28/2013

I used it on my daughters hair and it worked just as promised.  I am African American and this is the first hair dryer that I have purchased that has actually lived up to its claims.  My daughter has thick hair and this dryer literally cut the drying time in half.  The handle is comfortable to hold and the attachments work perfectly.  Also this hair dryer is much quieter than older models similar to this one.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone who hates long drying times.  It gets the job done and it gives your hair a natural shine.	3/8/2014

Let me say that I went from a $150 Chi dryer to this.  All in all, it seems to dry my hair in about the same time (I have a lot of hair).  In my opinion, the main difference between inexpensive and expensive dryers is how long they last.  I've had the expensive one for about 3 years or more, no issues.  The good thing about this Revlon (in addition to the price) is that it is much lighter weight.  So, I'll keep using it until it breaks.  One other thing to note, the cool burst button is really easy to accidentally trigger when you're drying your hair. Not a big deal other than it annoys me when I'm trying to dry my hair and the cold air starts flowing and I have to adjust."	12/22/2014

"When I ordered this hair dryer, I ordered the black with Pink petals. What I received was an all pink hair dryer. I was a little disappointed that I didn't receive the actual hair dryer that I ordered and I believe that the other hair dryer might have been better than this one. I have ordered other hair dryers from Xtava in the past and have been really impressed with the quality and performance of the hair dryers. This hair dryer is nice and small, so it is compact and easily fits even in a drawer. Even though it is small it is a powerful hair dryer and does dry my hair without frizzing it. To me it seemed a little heavy for it being such a small dryer. It was actually louder than my bigger hair dryers. It does have a nice long cord so I am able to move around more and not be confined in standing in one place. It does come with 2 attachments 1 nozzle is long and thin and the other is shorter and wider. It does have 3 heat selections (low, medium and high) and does have 2 speeds (gentle and strong). The feature I like the best about the dryer is the cool air which shoots out a burst of cool air and that is why my hair doesn't frizz when using this dryer.<br /> I was able to receive this hair dryer so that I can provide my honest opinion and feedback."	3/25/2015

This is my second one the first one quit working because I wrapped the cord around the dryer and broke the wires at the end that goes into the dryer.  My own fault and I am being very careful not to make the same mistake again.  Lost without it while I waited to get the replacement. Great settings for low and high heat and slow and fast speeds plus the cool button. You really can't go wrong with this hair dryer. I am now on my third dryer and the same thing happened to this one the cord broke just past the reinforced cord portion. I will continue to purchase this hair dryer because of all of the other features because it is so light weight and the heat and drying speed controls. Just wish the cord would stop breaking.  I was care not to twist it around the dryer this time but it still broke.	9/2/2014

The hair dryers they equip the rooms with were amazing and I kept telling my husband how much I loved it and how quick it dried my hair!! (I wanted to take it home but he wouldn't let me! ha) He told me it was probably just the dry air there and didn't understand my excitement over this hair dryer. Long story short, I got on Amazon as soon as we got home and ordered it. I AM IN LOVE! This hair dryer cuts your drying time in half and leaves hair shiny and smooth (and trust me, I have frizzy, wavy hair!)

Quick Drying, No Fly-Away Hair."	"I have been using an older model Remington hair dryer, and, while that model has held up well with daily use for over 3 years, this newer model is lighter weight and slightly smaller yet produces the same results as the old model.<br /><br />This Remington says that it has micro conditioners to prevent heat damage and increase hair shine. It also says that its ceramic technology prevents hair damage and dries hair faster.<br /><br />Since using the Remington hair dryers (daily) my hair (untreated and treated) do not show hair damage at all - no split ends, no dry/brittle, no fly-away. Whether this is attributable to the dryer or my hair product (changed when I started treating my hair), I cannot say. I use shampoo & conditioners about every other day and dry my hair every day.<br /><br />Dry time is fast. The new model doesn't seem to have a faster dry, but the dry time is pretty quick nonetheless. I do not use either attachment. This dryer comes with a diffuser (Remington caught flak with the last model not including a diffuser) and a directional blower. Both are standard plastic.<br /><br />Overall, this Remington dryer works well, dry well, and should last a number of years if it follows in previous models' footsteps. Very happy with the feel and results."	8/23/2015

"I don't write many reviews; but this hair dryer is the absolute best that I have ever owned and very reasonably priced.  I live in humid south Florida and have shoulder length thick hair that tends to frizz.  I have always taken care to dry my hair carefully and thoroughly with a round brush; however, after a stint in the Florida heat I am all frizz again.  I decided to upgrade my hair dryer and read many reviews before selecting this one.  I do have to add that most of the recommended hair dryers were priced well over $50 which just seems like too much to me.  The Remington AC9096 had both great reviews and a reasonable price and best of all -- IT WORKS.  I can dry my hair very quickly with this dryer using a large round brush and the end result is soft, smooth, shiny, frizz-free hair that stays frizz free even when I am outdoors.  I have not had any issues with my hair getting caught on the dryer, but like I said,  my hair is only shoulder length. If you have hair that tends to frizz in the humidity,  buy this dryer.

I wasn't eager to start filling the holes and repainting the spot and maybe the whole bathroom if I couldn't match the wall color.<br />Yippee!  I ordered one that looked similar and attached over the old bracket.<br />The new dryer is perfect!	1/28/2013

I can tell you definitively that it has 3 heat settings, but only 2 fan settings.  The only difference between the medium and high settings is the temperature that blows out.  The fan speeds are actually low and medium.  It turns out that this worked out fine for me, because I wanted a dryer that didn’t feel like a hurricane while trying to style my short hair.<br /><br />People with long, thick hair probably won’t like this dryer because it doesn’t have a real powerful fan speed.  May I recommend for you guys the Conair 1875 Watt Ion Shine Hair Styler.  That dryer has 2 fan speeds, one is a gentle breeze, the other a virtual hurricane, but I bet it dries long hair in a jiffy.  I have relegated that dryer to the closet, perhaps to dry hand-washed clothes or something like that."	5/7/2014

I used it around three times a week in the morning. Went to plug it in yesterday and turned it on, and nothing happened but a tiny little pop. Since then I've tried resetting the switch on the plug itself as well as tried various outlets around the house. Something seems to have shorted out in it. I figured a hair dryer was a hair dryer and the $20 one should work just as well, but after this experience and after using better ones that my friends have had serve them well for several years and dry my hair more quickly, I think I'll pony up the extra $20 and save myself the headache of having to buy another hair dryer in the near future. It's possible mine was just defective, but even if it hadn't gone out on me, I probably would have gotten a nicer dryer for myself as a treat at some point anyway, knowing how often I use blow dryers and how much better they work on my thicker hair."	8/15/2011

"I have been a stylist for over 10 years now and was also a auto mechanic too, so I do have knowledge on how things work. People blaming the dryer on damaging their wife's hair are idiots. If the hair was breaking off its due to her stylist over processing her hair! I dryer isn't going to break hair.........it melts/burns it and only if the user doesn't properly know how to use it. Probably why the husband is writing the review cause he is the woman in the relationship since the woman probably has no clue how to cook since you can't keep one area under constant heat for too long of a period.<br /><br />No for a real review!<br /><br />I owned the origanl version of the dryer by paramount velectra the. Which was a full size dryer with a long cord and worked great for the 7 yrs I owned it till it was stolen......I guarantee it is still working.<br /><br />So 3 years ago a old girlfriend bought the sedu version since many of the top educators in the hair industry use it (even the new Sam villa dryer is very similar).  It may be heavy for some people, but it is well balanced. Has a long cord like the old the, controls are never in the way....so it not changing the settings in the middle of a blow dry like you would with all the chi's. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to blow drying.........haven't even owned a flat iron in the last 5 years since most my clients like volume and movement. The sedu gets the job done faster than any dryer on the market......makes the t3 look like a Helen of troy dryer. I got lucky and was able to pick up the tgr 4000i (same dryer) from a beauty supply store for $37........these dryers were once priced at $280 6-7 years ago. Btw.......I finally picked up a flat iron this week........GHD is the only way to go........I used to own a chi and a digital chi wet to dry and there is no comparison."	8/15/2012

Yes, the<br />controls can easily get flipped around, but the temp and<br />air flow is ideal for those of us with super fine  and fragile<br />curly hair.  Whatever they are doing to these ion hairdryers<br />is nothing desirable for me.  They always frizz me out.<br />  I use the high heat high speed setting with the hot air<br />pik to straighten and volumize my hair, or use round brushes<br />and vary the heat along each section of hair.  No matter how<br />I style it, I come out with much shinier less frizzy hair.<br />Rewind about 2003-2004: Bought this model in a store,<br />loved it, and used it til it died in about 2007. Bought<br />another from a different store.  Everything was fine at first.<br />Then when I would use it the breaker would trip.  At first<br />it only happened once or twice, which is just one of those<br />things that can happen for no good reason.  I bought another<br />after the electrician ok'd everything.  I figured it was just a<br />bad dryer.  So I bought one more from a different store.<br />Worked fine until it sparked and a flame came out the end.<br />After a burned hand I decided I should try and find another<br />dryer.  Around 2012 I was talking to a friend who works in<br />the salon industry and she told me the company that made<br />my favorite dryer had changed the way they made them.<br />That made me think it was worth one last shot.  I have moved<br />from where I used all my other dryers.  First couple dries went<br />great.  However, I don't trust it not to use it in a non GFCI<br />outlet.  Last couple times I used it the GFCI activated and<br />turned it off.  Now I'm convinced it is a safety hazard, or<br />at the very least a challenge the electrical system doesn't<br />need.  I'm heartbroken over that.  If the manufacturer could<br />address that problem, I would be SO happy.<br />The seller on Amazon was reasonably priced and got my<br />item to me quickly and ingood condition."	6/9/2015

"I have had the opportunity to try quite a few Xtava products and I am overwhelmed by the quality of their items.  I'd never heard of Xtava prior to November and for being a virtual unknown in the heavily competitive beauty market, they really are creating products that will last.  I hope that they are able to get a foothold in this industry and keep on making such great items!<br /><br />The Rimini blow dryer for starters, is a gorgeous hair dryer.  We desperately needed a new hair dryer because ours is ready to die anytime now.  This definitely is a step up from the cheapo dryer we had purchased.<br /><br />It drys our hair so quickly.  Even my daughter who has much thicker and coarse hair than myself it doesn't take much time at all until her hair is completely dry.  There are two speed settings, low and high as well as three heat settings plus the Cold Shot button.  I find that I use the medium heat and the high speed settings the most.<br /><br />I also love that it has a little hook on it so that you can easily hang it on a nail for easy access in your bathroom.  The cord is long enough to be able to style your hair just about anywhere you need it.  It's not like REAL quiet, but it's not as loud as some hairdryers.  It really is one of the best dryer's I've used and it's definitely the best hair dryer that I've ever personally owned!!  I'm so impressed by the quality of Xtava and their products!<br /><br />**  Review Product Received"	1/24/2015

First, this is NOT a particularly quiet hair dryer. Having been used to really quiet dryers in Europe, where the EU sets noise standards on such appliances, I have constantly been frustrated by the obnoxious noise levels of hair dryers here in the U.S. So, as American blow dryers go, this one is pretty good, especially on the SET setting, but it's certainly NOT exceptionally quiet. Nor is it lighter in weight than the dryer I currently have. So buy it for the functionality, but not for the sound level or the weight. However, one big advantage is that this dryer has a normal size plug, rather than the ginormous ones with the pop-out breaker that are common on other products sold in the U.S. Our bathroom outlets already have the pop-out breakers so we don't need them on appliances used in the bathroom, so not having to accommodate the giant plug is a big plus."	12/29/2014

I had an old Conair hair dryer since early 2000's and it finally took a dive. What I loved about my old dryer was how lightweight and powerful it was. I searched on Amazon for the same and/or similar style and came across this. The Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic hair dryer is as good or better than the older version, which had the same wattage. It is lightweight, powerful, and so comfortable to use. The switches were an important part for me. I love the slide switches because you can grab it by the handle and not accidentally turn it off while you're using it. I have very long and thick hair and this gets the job done! If you're the type of person who doesn't want sore arms when drying your hair, this is perfect for you!"	11/17/2014

I bought it two weeks ago after reading the reviews and absolutely all the positive reviews about it are true. I love the power it throws out. It is quick and nice in doing its business. It is a little noisy but I guess that is something which I felt in my previous dryers from other brands too. A point to note however is that though the product description indicates ...and removable concentrator make this a versatile styler..., there is no concentrator that I received in my package. So if you are looking for a hair dryer with a diffuser or concentrator, then this product does not come with one and you may need to search and buy one separately."	4/3/2013

I have shoulder-length hair, so it's not a problem but it seems like that could be a problem.

Makeovers and upgrades don't always yield the best results. For instance, this 1875 replica. Lacks the basic functions a blow dryer should have, such as temperature adjustment. There is only a setting for high and low fan speed. Also, in order to use the air only feature with no heat, the cooling button has to be pressed and held down to use this basic function. This causes a person's fingers to get tired, holding a button over using a sliding switch. Then there is the retracted cord that is missing. That was probably the most valuable feature for the original Conair 1875. Made the dryer much more portable. Even useful when not traveling. Now the new 1875 has its cord sprawled all over the bathroom counter. The original is much better.

I had it for at least 4 years, before the back filter broke, and then my hair started getting sucked into the back.<br /><br />So I tried several different dryers, even expensive name brand ones like Babyliss, none that I really LOVED like this one.  I recently chopped my hair off, and am using a less powerful dryer.  But after realizing my love for this dryer, I went ahead and bought a second one, and have it put up in my closet, to use again once my hair grows back out, and I need that 'power' to straighten and dry quickly<br /><br />Only CON is that is IS a bit heavy... after having no luck with lighter ones, I realize the weight is worth it."	7/2/2015

Its long and thick and my arms are hurting because it takes so long to get everything dry. I can't ever get a style to hold. I tried a blow out once. Once. So when I was given the opportunity to review this product for free I thought &#34;what do I have to lose?&#34;<br /><br />Thats when I realized ive always just had a crappy blowdryer. The cord is super long and thick so it doesn't get very tangled during use and I have freedom of movement. The power is really amazing. It only took about 10 minutes give or take. I appreciate the warm setting because heat dries my scalp out. The blast of cool air made my hair shiny. The nozzle was great for taming frizz.

"First of all, let's put things in perspective -- I am not a stylist.  I don't use a blow dryer to style my hair, but rather to dry it after showering.  I have very thin, fine hair that dries quickly but easily gets frizzy and fly-away.  The hand dryer I've had for over 15 years did the job, but unless I used a leave-in conditioner before drying, my hair would often end up looking like shredded wheat.  Not attractive!<br /><br />So when it came time to buy a new dryer, I took a look at the ionic ones, which claim to leave hair soft and silky instead of frizzy and fly-away.  And since this one was so inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Well, it's fabulous!  When dried with this dryer, my hair actually feels silky.  And my hair has NEVER felt silky!  And to make things even better, that silkiness lasts between shampoos.<br /><br />I've read a few complaints here that the blower on this dryer isn't strong enough, or it doesn't get hot enough.  They may have a point -- the air emitted does seem to be less hot than my much older Conair.  But the blower seems strong enough for me.  My hair dries in about the same amount of time as it did with my old dryer.<br /><br />But what makes this so great isn't the heat or the amount of air, it's the ionic thing.  I don't know why it works, or how it works, but I love this thing, and the fact that it actually costs LESS than the one I bought fifteen years ago is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />It's a great dryer and it won't set you back much.  What's better than that?"	5/25/2014

The top button controls hot/warm/cold, while the second button has the high/low/off settings. The electric plug is shock-proof. And a quick cold button is placed directly under the index finger.<br /><br />Once turned on, the motor immediately makes a statement of its superior quality with its calm low-frequency whirl and the strong yet steady airflow. In the long run, this should be what reminds the owner that he/she has gotten his/her money's worth. The air filter in the back of the unit is sturdy and easy to clean.

Quick blast cold button (takes about 2-3 seconds to get cold when you push the button)<br />  2. Cold temperature setting (so the air blows cold without having to push the button)<br />  3. Medium/warm (this is the setting I always use and it is plenty warm enough to dry my hair very quickly)<br />  4. Ouch, my scalp is burning (I never use this setting because my hair is fine and it's way too hot for me)<br /><br />**One thing I really like about this hair dryer is that no matter what setting you're using, even if it's the hottest setting, the dryer itself does not get hot to the touch and remains cool.<br /><br />WEIGHT: It does feel a little heavier than I'm used to. I notice the weight of it when I pick it up and it feels heavy in my hand, but the ergonomic shape of the handle allows me to hold it right near the top so my arm doesn't really get tired. It weighs approximately 1-lb-11-oz , which isn't all that much but in comparison with an older dryer I had, it does feels like it weighs more. This is the only reason I took off a star.<br /><br />CORD: Long enough to allow me to easily dry my hair and move the dryer all over the place without running out of cord, but it doesn't get tangled or gnarly. It wraps up quick and clean.<br /><br />SPEEDS: It has two speed settings, high and low. I use it on medium temperature and high speed and my shoulder-length hair, which is also straight and fine, can go from soaking-wet-out-of-the-shower to dry in about 3 minutes.<br /><br />I couldn't really tell you if the ion action is working, because I don't have any way to really tell, but it gets my hair dry quickly with lots of volume and it feels fairly smooth when I'm done, even when I don't use a brush to blow it out. I recently went on a trip and left my dryer at home, which meant I used the tiny little hair dryer in the hotel. After a couple days of that I was VERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer. I am a mom of 4 and I don't have extra time to waste drying my hair, so the faster it can get done the better. This one definitely gets the job done.ERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer.

I don't think I would have come up with that on my own, so of course I then started researching hair dryers. There are about as many 'Top Ten Hair Dryer' lists as I think there are hair dryers! While there are a couple of (pricey) brands that tend to show up on most of those lists, I finally decided to look at it a different way ie: what 'technologies' exist and what would work best with my hair. I like a lot of volume and smoothness, so ionic, ceramic, tourmaline with infra red seemed to fit the bill - which is everything this dryer has. I read pretty much all of the reviews, watched the YouTube videos and even tho' people complained about the weight and button positions, I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say that I am literally blown away! First, I understand why people complain about the button position as the first time I used it, I also kept changing speed and heat settings. However, it took me no time at all to figure out how to hold it so that doesn't happen. The heat levels are nice and consistent and the Cool Shot button works great - doesn't 'lock' but I don't care as I just shoot the roots before I finish each section so works fine for me. Regarding the weight, that was the only thing that I was a bit concerned about at first, since my old dryer was super light.  Now, after using it for the second time, I didn't even notice the weight, only the incredibly awesome results it produces! I actually feel like I have new hair as it is no longer dry and frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy. I still can't believe changing hair dryers could make such a difference. I actually look forward to doing my hair now! My recommendation is, do your research, but if you have hair similar to mine, give this fantastic dryer a try - I don't think you'll be disappointed!frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy.

I thought I must have switched it to low on accident until I double checked and I didn't. Then it went back to the normal high setting but every time I tried pointing it towards my hair it would switch back to the low setting with in 5-10 seconds. It took me three times as long to blow dry my hair where it came out all nice and frizzy (even when using a round brush). The hot setting when it did decide to be hot (big reason I bought this) wasn't very hot either (which probably caused more frizz).

I have long thick slightly wavy hair that falls just below my shoulders. It usually takes 20-30 minutes to dry with a regular hair dryer and a paddle brush to keep it straight and tame the frizzies. The Remington Tstudio Pearl cut my drying time in half! My hair did indeed dry faster and came out smoother looking with a silky shine. To top it off, I barely needed to use my paddle brush to straighten it--only a few brush strokes here and there to keep it knot free. My only complaint is the cord could be a little longer. I have to plug my hair dryer up above my head next to the light fixture of our medicine cabinet and the shorter cord makes drying my hair upside down for added volume next to impossible.

"A hair dryer is not something I generally replace until I need it.  Mine is still working,  but I had been saying for a while that I needed a new one.  I've always just looked at it as something that blows air and that they are all pretty much the same.  After using this one a few times,  I will never say that again.  This hair dryer is awesome.  I had already switched my curling irons to ionic ceramic and could tell a big difference,  but I didn't realize that it would also make a difference in a hair dryer.  Not only does it dry my hair faster,  but it leaves it looking much more healthy.  I have very long hair and even though I take good care of it,  I had noticed that it was looking dull and dry.  The first time I used this dryer,  I could tell a difference.  I don't know all the &#34;how&#34; or &#34;why&#34; reasons,  but I do know that my hair didn't look or feel like all the moisture had been stripped from it.  I had even started to air dry my hair because I could see what was happening to it,  but that takes a long time with thick , long hair.  I will still air dry when I have the time,  but now I feel like I can dry my hair quickly (and this dryer does it VERY quick),  and not be damaging it.  I don't use the high heat on this one because it's very hot and my fine hair wouldn't like that,  but I like knowing that the option is there if needed.  The air flow with this is massive.....really powerful... When on high,  I can dry my hair in a few minutes,  but that's only when I'm just drying it to put in a ponytail.  Medium is more than enough airflow to dry and style it, and I love the cool setting.  When I used a round brush to curl,  I finished with the cool setting and it made all the difference.  It's not a small dryer,  but it's not at all heavy ,  especially considering the power that it contains.<br />  They include a little card explaining that their products are made by women.  I find that reassuring, since most men that I know don't really use one,  therefore,  how could they know what we need.  They also donate a portion of their profits to charities that benefit women.  Between that and the fact that you get such a high end, quality made product  for such a reasonable price,  I  am totally sold on this company.  You can tell that they care about their products.  I highly recommend it.  I can't imagine anyone not loving it.<br />I did receive this product free for the purpose of testing and reviewing with my honest opinion,  and I couldn't be happier to tell you how wonderful this dryer is.efore,  how could they know what we need.

Having said that, there is nothing to dislike about it once you are settled on using it at home. At 1875 Watt, this packs enough power that matches most current hairdryers. It has two heat settings---high and low, and there is a button that turns off the heating element so that cool air continues to blow. The motor seems hard-working enough that I have never experienced any overheating issues. Now I understand that there is some claim about certain ceramic and ion technology that should give a smoother hair. Perhaps it's my hair, but in practice, I don't notice any difference from my existing hairdryer I bought several years back from a brand starting V-S.    Overall, I think this is a solid hairdryer that does the job just fine. However, don't expect any novelty."	9/13/2011

No warning, no apparent problems, nothing to lead me to believe it wouldn't last a long time.  It just stopped working and would not start again.  The dryer still looks new, no scratches, no lint in the air intake screen, no kinks in the cord, but is doesn't work.  Before it quit, I would have given it four stars (deducting one for being rather loud), the fact that it lasted barely more than one year makes me want to give it zero stars.

But, the use of toggle switches for power and temperature right on the handle instead of a sliding switch seems like poor planning at best.  Every time I change hand positions I'm accidentally turning it off or moving it from hot to warm.  The only way to avoid doing that is to not put your hand around the inside of the handle - I've dropped the dumb thing on the floor more times than I can count while trying to avoid turning it off!  All other dryers I've ever used have switches that slide up or down and only move when you want them to, not just if you accidentally touch it.  And the cord is very short as well - much shorter than any I've had in the past.  This dryer will be going to &#34;back-up&#34; status as soon as I get a better replacement."	1/28/2014

The Remington AC2015 does its job nice and quickly.<br /><br />I have long (almost waist length), thick, and very straight hair. I wash them every 2-3 days using natural products (Lush shampoo and conditioner), and also oil them a couple times a week (Jojoba oil + either rosemary or lavender essential oil). I use a wooden brush - but only when they're dry. So yes, I really love and care for my hair! But when it comes to drying them, I can't imagine to spend a lot of time doing it. My drying routine is simple: 1) I remove most of the water with a towel (gently) and use my fingers to remove tangles; 2) then I blow-dry my hair upside down; 3) finally, I brush them. The whole procedure takes me approx. 15 minutes, using the maximal power (level 3) and heat (again 3) of the hair dryer.<br /><br />My husband has way shorted and fewer hair than I do, straight and thin. He uses my same shampoo and conditioner, but won't do anything more than that. He wouldn't need to use a hair dryer, but love the feeling. It takes him less than a minute to be perfectly dry.<br /><br />My dog is a Scottish Terrier - so she's small but has longish and super thick fur. We wash her in the bathtub with natural Castille soap. To dry her fur, we first wrap her in a towel, and remove most of the water, then we use the hair dryer alternating medium heat (level 2) and cold air to avoid burning her skin. When she starts being somewhat dryer, we use her brush to attack the most hidden hair (e.g. armpits). It takes us approx. 1 hour.<br /><br />To sum up, this hair dryer is durable and high quality - a great bang for the buck!"	7/18/2015

So I was trying to figure out how to change the battery/s for this toothbrush --- for a long time - lol too long! And I was feelin' a bit dumb (lol). I had  always had a problem with the switch with the  Arm & Hammer Spinbrush® Swirl®. tooth brush - it was easy to turn on but it was actually a puzzle (not intuitive, to me anyway) to shut off. LOL - I knew the design of this T/Brush had out smarted me in the past so putting ego aside I went to the Web with my problem and to the Electric Tooth Brush Manufacture's site [...] by Arm & Hammer. I must say this is Very FLASH-e Web Site. (lol) Very typical, over the top - big company stuff! Designed for the Suit Client not the Toothbrush Customer. The web sit does not have a Site Search Field, I knew I was in for it right then!  YES there is a Q & A page but there is a lame Ask Us page that is really just a badly titled where to buy landing page., ([...]). It seems like you need to go two levels of pages in on this site to discover this page link found on the ASK US PAGE: [...] On the  FAQ page, How to change the battery for this model Spinbrush® Swirl® was an unanswered question, others yes full and complete How To's, but not for this model! Curious? Which led me to Amazon to see what others knew about the Arm & (and) Hammer Spinbrush® Swirl®. I found my answer at Amazon. It seems instead of just saying that you have to toss this thing in the landfill where it will last for who know's how long the A&H approach is omission. Just not talking about the issue with their customers? It was almost like they were too embarrassed to put in writing the truth about such an un-ecofriendly electric tooth brush. Lessons I learned: I wasted a lot of time, I found the solution to my problem very quickly on Amazon, & I got what I paid for when I bought the cheapest Electric Toothbrush I could find.

"I just paid 189.00 for this hair dryer on another site (not Amazon) because I read the reviews Amazon is NOT an authorized dealer and the problems people had with this dryer and returning it (or warranty, whatever).  My least concern was this I just wanted to be sure I was getting the Evolution and not some other model with the name Evolution  on it.  First, OMG..what /who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews?  This dryer is NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How can anyone say best hair dryer ever. no need for the low setting as the high is perfect, blah blah.  I am convinced that I can no longer go by reviews on here. This dryer is in NO WAY 2000 watts.  I can hold the nozzle (with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow) right to my skin and my sking doesnt even get close to warm.  How can this dryer be 20000 watts when it is barely blowing out any air to even directly make it to my round brush and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting, which is supposed to be Hot?  This is in now way hot, no way 20000 watts, I dont even think this is 1600.  What are all you people thinking to write reveiws with a dryer that is no stronger than a conair at CVS?  I cannot in good conscious keep a dryer that I paid almost 200 for where my vidal sassoon dryer gives off more air flow.  I have NO RESPECT for a company that LIES to every one, puts out a dryer that is even in the news and yet sells top popele the EXACT OPPOSITE>?  Why are not you all saying the truth.  I have the dryer.  It is not even 1600 watts and that is no lie.  Plus, I paid 200 for a dryer where the cold button i have to hold down???  The cheaper dryers, yes.  But I also bought an 1875 BioIonic dryer and it blows stronger and harder than this piece of garbage.  AND its cool button stays cool without holding it down.  The only positive of this dryer is light weight.  But I can get that at the local drug store for 30.00  Pleaswe people, THINK before you write reviews and be honest.  I have to believe these sites are deceptive becau8se I have the dryer, I used it and it is clearly and no mistake or even maybe..THIS IS CLEARLY NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS, so light air flow I thought my electric ay be the problem.  So light it didnt burn my skin on highest hot setting up agaqinst my arm.  Are you kidding me people?  This is NOT A DRYER WORTH $50.00.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE and I for one will never EVER trust this company again. They have wasted my money, time and now I have to return this piece of garbage.  I can't believe the LIE of telling people waht a great piece of workmanship?  What is so great?  It is light, plastic, 1600 watt cheap deryer.  That's it."	10/3/2011

This one is the nice true compact type I like.  It also has decent quality of wire (some of that cheap wire nowadays hardly bends), and the cord is a generous 6 feet. The long cord is also a big selling point since a lot of the newer dryers have 4 foot cords.  I cannot comment on the international power settings since this will probably only be used in North America.  It does have 2 separate blowing speeds. The high speed is good, but my older dryer is just a little more powerful.  However, this one is good enough and the controls are set up for easy one-handed usage, with high, then &#34;off&#34; then &#34;low&#34; all on one simple power button. My hands are arthritic and this is much easier button placement than having the buttons on the front of the handle.  Also has a hanging loop as shown in the photo and I will be using that rather than folding the cord up after each use to store it.  Overall, this feels like a high quality product and over the past month or so I have used it, has been excellent.  I would buy it again, and no stupid folding handle to try and get &#34;compact&#34; rating."	7/3/2013

Yikes!  While it did dry my very straight, fine hair quickly, the air flow was so strong that when I put my hair in velcro curlers, the Revlon hair dryer blew the curlers out of my hair!  So I went looking on my beloved Amazon to find a better hair dryer with lots of positive reviews, and ended up ordering this for about the same price I paid for the Revlon one.  This one is great--so much more substantial and quality feeling and noticeably quieter and less shrill sounding than the Revlon.<br /><br />My single complaint is that the toggle switches on the handle that control the air flow and heat settings are a little too easy to accidentally change when drying your hair.  But I still like this hair dryer a lot."	3/7/2015

Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about whether there would be any difference between this hairdryer and the $20 ones I have been using my whole life.  I couldn't be more wrong!  This dryer is truly head and shoulders above anything I've tried before.  Please read on to hear about the technology, results and how to properly use this should you be convinced to take the plunge!<br /><br />The Technology<br />Rather amazing technology here from the engineers at Panasonic.  Using a high electric potential they create negative ions which trap water molecules from the air and combine them with the hot air jet of a conventional dryer.  By doing this, they buffer the air jet with moisture which in turn prevents damage to hair.  Panasonic has been leaders in this area of technology which is why Japan enjoys the best selection of such hair dryers.<br /><br />The Results<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, hair is dried quicker and with softer, shinier results!  My hair is short, but for most women with longer hair, the results should be even better!  It is designed to run cooler to protect hair from heat, so if you dry your hair everyday you would significantly reduce cumulative damage to hair.<br /><br />Before you use:<br />You must be aware of the electrical requirements for using this fine hair dryer.  Since it was designed for the Japanese domestic market, it is made for their electrical system, not the U.S.  Although the plugs in Japan and the U.S. look the same, the electricity supply is very different.  I am an electrical engineer and I have lived in Japan, continue to use many Japanese products in the U.S. so I understand the differences well and how to work around them.  In Japan they use 100 volts, however in the U.S. we use 120 volts.  That means by plugging in a Japanese product directly into the U.S. system, you would overload the product by 20%.  For a high wattage device like a hair dryer that is a considerable amount over the intended design!  Indeed some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.  However, if properly used this should not happen.  In fact, I noticed that when I use mine, the hair dryer itself stays quite cool.<br /><br />See my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v (if it were ok for U.S. it would have a range that included 120v).  I have also posted 2 pictures of my dryer plugged in to a transformer.  Note the first one with the power off, my voltage reader measures 105volts (this is close enough to 100v).  The second one has the power on, and it is consuming 1148 watts.  (That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)<br /><br />I warn that a proper stepdown transformer (capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer) will be expensive.  But used within its capacity will last forever.  I personally recommend Japanese made transformers from companies such as Sanyo, Nissyo or Toyozumi.  I have heard poor quality control on Chinese made ones, so given the high cost of the dryer (or any other Japanese product you would consider, i.e. Panasonic Nanocare steamer) I would invest in the best transformer.  Furthermore, I would not hesitate to purchase a Japanese transformer used on eBay as these are very durable items and you can often get a great deal (they come up from time-to-time.)<br /><br />5 stars!  When used properly will provide incredibly healthy looking hair!d some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.

"I use this dryer exclusively for when I color my hair with a henna because henna is heat activated.  So I do not use rollers but just put the bonnet on after applying the henna. (Not sure why the byline says from a 12-year-old reader.)     The high setting does a great job activating the henna, but the bonnet is so heavy that it collapses on top of my head and is so hot that it would burn if I did not hold it up manually.  Except since the bonnet gets too hot to touch, I attach a clothespin to it and hold the clothespin up for the 50 minutes that the henna is cooking.    It may work better with rollers, but the best idea would be to make a lighter bonnet that puffs up on its own, like the one that came with the old Carel dryers.    When I called the manufacturer to tell them that the bonnet acts that way, they were defensive.  If they could fix that problem, they'd have a much better dryer."	7/2/2011

With 1875 Watts, it dries even thick hair quickly when used on the high setting.  The handle folds to make it more compact for storage.<br /><br />This is a basic hair dryer wiith only two speeds, high and low, and one temperature unless you hold down the &#34;cool&#34; button at the top of the handle.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles of more expensive models -- no ceramic coils or diffuser or ionic upgrades.  The handle has a switch to convert from 125 V to 250 V, and you MUST know the voltage of the country you're visiting and manually change the setting or else risk starting a fire.  Remember to change it back when you get home.  A few countries, however, use lower voltages than 125: many Caribbean countries, Japan, Taiwan, and a few South American countries.  Check your destination before you go.  The hair dryer would be completely universal if the power pack handled a range between 100-250 V.  It would also be more useful if it converted automatically the way computer chargers do; however, I've never seen an automatic conversion on a hair dryer.<br /><br />On American current, this is a powerful little hair dryer.  Although most hotels supply hair dryers these days, it works well for those times when either you're not sure you'll find one and when you want to depend on something you know.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"	3/27/2015

He told me to buy from Amazon for best price, and to make sure I chose the Featherweight T3 by  Bespoke Labs.  It is delicate; I keep it in the box and put it away as soon as I'm done, which is 10-12 minutes.  If it is dropped, the tourmaline technology can be damaged and will not work.

Good for drying hair, not good for blowing large spiders across a tile floor (limited cord reach and range of power).

I thought it would be very nosy because I've never had a home hair dryer that wasn't; however, it was actually pretty quiet for a hair dryer.<br /><br />There are two speeds: medium and fast.  The medium is so powerful I thought it would be enough to dry my thick, long hair, but it doesn't run at its hottest on medium speed.  Turn it up to full blast though and it's as hot as any professional hair dryer my hair dresser uses.<br /><br />It comes with two attachments:  1)the nozzle that directs the air flow in a small space, which is great for styling by running the nozzle down a shaft of hair on a round brush.  This is what I use to make my hair straight.  2) the round diffuser for curly hair.  Scrunch your hair in front of it to diffuse the air flow and keep your locks curly.<br /><br />The on/off switch and the switch to change the temperature are convenient to use while drying.<br /><br />The coolest part is that it's red."	10/15/2013

I have really long hair extensions and they take FOREVER to dry, and after reading the reviews for this dryer I decided to try it because they say drying in half the time.<br />They weren't kidding, this dryer is AMAZING to say the least, I have never owned such a great product that is so inexpensive; so do yourself a favor, purchase this dryer, you wont be sorry, it is truly the best! Even on cool or medium speed this thing is magnificent! Some of the reviews comment on this dryer being heavy, I'll share a secret...cheap dryers are superlight weight, but in all sincerity, this dryer is not heavy at all, so not sure why some reviews say this. The button placement was an issue when I read the reviews but decided to try it for myself, and what I personally found was, where I place my hand is at the bottom anyways, so it was a non issue for me. It's totally worth trying because everyone is going to hold their dryer in a different spot anyways, and if I didn't purchase this based on what others said about weight and button placement, I would have missed out on the BEST DRYER EVER, and believe me, I have tried them all. And side note, it really does dry in half the time, which means an extra 20 mins in the morning hitting the snooze button ; )"	2/6/2015

Knocking off a star from 4-star to 3-star. This apparently is a common complaint. I took it apart to see if anything can be done but the flip switch itself needs to be replaced and I haven't found a suitable replacement since no part number is indicated.

I found it at walmart for $35, which wasn't the most expensive one that they had, but I've used John Frieda products before so I figured it would be a good try. So far, I really like this dryer. It feels like it could be a lot more expensive.<br />I compared it to my mother's $80 or so hairdryer and it actually keeps up with it pretty well. I really like how the engine feels and sounds. It works pretty quiet and has a low hum rather than the high pitched noise a lot of cheap-o hairdryers have. It doesn't shoot the air quite as fast and it doesn't get QUITE as hot as the $80 blowdryer my mom has, but it's pretty great at it's job because my hair actually looks better when I use this hairdryer vs the more expensive one. It definitely fights frizz very well.<br />The only problem I'd say I have with it is that it's a heavier dryer than my old one that broke. I say problem because people may dislike that but I prefer it that way. When dryers have a bit of weight to them I feel like they've got a stronger motor. Not to mention I really don't notice when I'm using it.<br />As for the people complaining about the buttons, I can't say that I can relate. I guess I have very small hands so I can hold the dryer pretty well without messing with the buttons too badly, but so far EVERY blow dryer I've seen has the buttons on the side pannel like that, I think you just have to get used to it.<br />Overall, awesome dryer. I'm very happy I purchased it."	7/10/2012

IT COULD SAVE YOU FROM BEING BUYING A DEFECTIVE ITEM THAT COULD BURN YOU!<br /><br />When I opened up the package, the packing for the blow-dryer was bent and looked open. Despite that, I thought maybe it just got damaged from shipping. When I opened up the package, it looked used. The blowdryer itself and the attachments (especially the diffuser) were all scratched; almost like they were used. Still, I thought, &#34;Maybe this was just a packaging issue and got damaged via UPS or during the shipping process.&#34; I wanted to test out the product before returning it. I severely regret even trying out this item before returning it.<br /><br />I plugged in the blow-dryer and attached the diffuser attachment. It didn't seem to blow air very well at all. My $25 Conair blow-dryer actually blows out more air than this did! I only had the blow-dryer plugged in for maybe a minute and realized it just didn't work. I actually got burnt because the diffuser got so hot! I now have a little welt on me from accidentally touching it. I can easily seeing this blow-dryer causing a fire or really harming somebody! I will never buy a 'Pro Beauty Tools' item again. The fact that this item was even labeled as a &#34;professional,&#34; blow-dryer is a joke. It blows no air and is cheaply made. The supposed $150 value is a joke, as well. Like I said, my $25 Conair blow-dryer is much, much better than this joke of a dryer<br /><br />Now I have no blow-dryer, a mini welt and irritated skin. Save your time, physical health and money and buy something else. Like I said, I can really see this endangering somebody -- whether by burning them severely (I wasn't even using the dryer for 2 minutes before becoming burnt) or causing a fire of some sort. The diffuser attachment also stayed hot for quite awhile which I've never seen before with a blow-dryer before."	7/25/2015

"After receiving a Conair cordkeeper for Christmas and only using it about 8 times, it died. Lucky I was able to get my money back at Walmart. So I decided to read lots of Amazon reviews on hairdryers in the $20-$30 price range and chose this one.<br />I loved it the first time I used it! It's a bit heavier but not bothersome at all, and I even have tennis elbow which prevents me from lifting things a certain way, if they weigh over 3# or so. This is very comfortable in the hands, has enough settings, a cold shot button, and most importantly, a diffuser for when I want to go from stick straight hair to beachy waves. The quality seems great and sturdy, I love the pink on it, and whatever the coating is is also pretty cool.<br />After my Conair experience, I don't have much faith in new hairdryers. I was using an old folding travel dryer I have (from 2007) that still works great and I plan on using for traveling, so my intent was to use the Remington for the diffuser. However, I think I will use it everyday, as it dries my hair fast and keeps it shiny and is just fun to use!"	5/28/2014

"The Infiniti by Conair Mighty Mini Tourmaline Ceramic Styler has traveled to many countries with me thanks to the ability to change voltage and is my favorite travel hair dryer.

The attachments (though I never use them) are a nice addition as well.  I do have to say that in some hotels and countries, I cannot use the high setting, I have to use the low setting otherwise the hairdryer will over heat.  I haven't had this problem in the US as much as I have in Europe.  It's really not that big of a deal because the low setting is still EXTREMELY powerful and drys my hair in a matter of minutes.  I have had several other mini dryers (both by Connair and by Revlon) but this is by far my favorite.  I've had it for four years and I hope to be able to use it for many more years to come!

"I have owned a T3 hairdryer for over 7 years now.  The first model I owned was the evolution model ($300 retail) and used it for 5 years.  I still have it and it works.  I replaced it with the feather weight model only because I had back surgery and the evolution was a little heavy to hold over the top of my head for any length of time, so I switched.      The feather weight is an excellent hairdryer - my hair is extremely thick and curly.  This dryer dries it from completely wet to dry, smooth and straight in 12 minutes and I have A LOT of hair.  I recommend using the attachment to concentrate the airflow exactly where you want it.  I only take the attachment off when I want to simply blow the water out of my hair before styling it - then I put the attachment back on.    Don't hesitate - especially if you have unruly, curly, thick hair that takes a long time to dry.  This one shortens the time, smooths the hair shaft, and straightens great.  I also use John Frieda products (especially the hairspray for curly hair) as well - the hairspray will keep your hair straight for one day - and that is a true fact!"	4/23/2011

I have medium length & thick hair just past my shoulders and my hair will dry completely with this dryer in 7 minutes.  My only complaint is that the plug is really loose to the wall so I have to plug it into an adapter I have otherwise it will literally fall out of the wall plug.  Also it is very short cord even when pulled out all of the way.  Sometimes when trying to retract the cord it gets stuck and wont go in all of the way so I have to keep pulling it in and out to try to get it to reel up all the way.  When it does this it makes me just want to wrap the cord around the dryer negating the whole idea of the reel.  Overall its been a good dryer though and am glad I have it and it was a good price."	9/24/2013

It fits standard hair dryer attachments too -  like a diffuser. It also comes with the attachment that focuses the air blast - I think it's called the nozzle, but it's key to minimizing damage on your hair.<br /><br />My last hair dryer (from a different brand) was closer to $65 and although it worked great, it started to breakdown within a couple of months. It finally cracked it half in my checked bag during a recent flight. The price was right for this dryer - and I love the customer-centric focus of the company, xtava.<br /><br />I also love the follow up communication I received after buying this - tips for how to use it well, contact info if I have any problems.

"It's a good, no-nonsense hair dryer, and I'm rating it as such.  Three heat settings and two speeds give it great versatility to do a speed dry or more leisurely styling assistance.<br /><br />I'm particularly fond of the removable filter...this is replacing an older hair dryer that was very difficult to clean.  I'm less fond of the attachments...not that they are bad or anything, only that I've never used any kind of attachments for a hair dryer.  They seem a little loose though, so I'm not sure of their ultimate utility.<br /><br />This does put out plenty of power, and it seems like a &#34;clean&#34; heat without a ton of noise.  It's not whisper-quiet, but it does seem a little more discreet than my old hair dryer.<br /><br />So  I do like this - it's handy with a decent amount of power behind it.  As I said, it's no-nonsense.  And I appreciate it."	8/18/2015

"I wanted a blow-dryer with a lot of power, but without a lot of noise.  This styler delivers on both counts.  There are two heat settings - the warm setting is not much higher than room temperature, and the hot setting is very warm.  There are also two power settings - low is just enough to dry without tangling, and high is perfect for pulling hair straight on a round brush.  The styler is not overly loud, and more importantly, it is without that annoying whine you get with some blow-dryers.  I have no idea if the &#34;Ionic&#34; part of it has any merit, as I haven't noticed that it dries my hair any faster or with less damage.  I have lots and lots of fine-textured, moderately curly hair, and this styler does a great job."	11/23/2013

The cord is long enough to plug into the wall and be able to use it 6ft away from the outlet. The hair dryer comes with the concentrator nozzle which I would have died without but it doesn’t bring the diffuser nozzle which I found kind of odd since most companies include both nozzles. Anyway, so I plugged in the hair dryer and started to blow dry my hair using the same brush I always use. I tested out the different heat settings and was impressed with how quickly the temperatures change. If you switch from hot to cold it happens instantly meanwhile I’ve owned hair dryers that take at least 20-30 seconds just to make the temperature change. The two different speed settings are your standard low and high, yet, at the high speed the noise the drier makes is not loud at all. The dryer isn’t completely soundless but it isn’t obnoxiously loud compared to others I’ve owned. I found that when I used this hair dryer my styling time was 20-30 minutes quicker than usual. In addition, my hair felt really smooth afterwards and the end result wasn’t as frizzy as I expected considering I have curly hair and I'm not a professional at blow drying.  UPDATE: After using the hairdryer for a few months, I noticed that whenever I would use this dryer my scalp would become very oily right after blow drying. Whenever I use my old Revlon hair dryer my scalp remains dry and I have never had this issue before. I haven't changed any other hair care or hair tool besides this dryer so this must be the culprit.  I did receive this complimentary for review purposes but this does not influence my opinion."	3/1/2015

However, it has two speeds which are comparable to other blow dryers.  It works great.  I use it every day.

I have had this dryer a few years now and I rarely use it due to its poor performance. It only has holes at the top of the hat so the air is only released at the top of your head and it does not dry the back and lower sides of your hair properly. You have to keep turning and twisting your head to get some of the air to blow on each quadrant of your head. The adjustable length is not very practical and you have to be creative about where you put the dryer and the chair you use in order to sit under the it comfortably. Do not buy this product!	6/24/2010

"I really wanted to love this dryer as it comes highly recommended by professional stylists.  I used it twice, it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush.  I was pleased with the results, after all this was a big step up from the half broken one I purchased from Sally's years ago.  Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  She told me I should try it.  When I used the rusk I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  I was in LOVE!!! It was a huge step up from the twinturbo.  I had to have the rusk, so I returned the twinturbo.  I could not be happier w the customer service.  Refund was super smooth.  So for the drier 3 stars customer service via Amazon and the seller 5 stars.<br /><br />Pros:  Dries fast, smooth results, nice button position.<br /><br />Cons: Heavy, the wind screen on the back has no cover, just flimsy screen. On both occasions I used the drier my long hair was sucked into the screen, causing it to tangle and burn.  In my opinion this is a design flaw. The hole in the back of the dryer is the circumference of my fist!<br /><br />Look to the rusk w8less!  It's an outstanding dryer!"	8/17/2015

Normally I wouldn't write a review, but this is the second Conair Infinity 223XR model I've owned that has exhibited identical problems: the cord stops retracting properly after a few uses and then the dryer one day simply ceases to function. The first one I purchased lasted almost 2 years before it stopped working. Because I take good care of my appliances and they tend to last a long time, I thought I had simply gotten a lemon. It happens to the best products every now and then. Unfortunately, the second one did not perform any better and stopped working after only 7 months. The problem doesn't appear to be motor or fan related. Rather, my husband suspects an electrical issue with either the cord or the plug. Regardless, I am done with this model!"	7/19/2013

The motor is pleasantly quiet.<br /><br />The only slight quibble I have with it is that the safety feature built into the power cord makes for an extra layer of on-off; and until I learned which button was on and which was emergency off I found myself fumbling around for half a minute before I could actually turn the dryer on.

It does everything I need it to, plus has two attachments I've never used (pinpointer and curler?) The 'cool' button actually gets cool pretty quick and feels a little cooler than the ambient temp. Doesn't have a 'medium' setting but I don't think that's worth 20 bucks. If you don't like the color blue, well you're outta luck. Guess since it isn't foldable, it may not be good for travel. Whatever, it blow dries my hair at home when I need it to and does a good job at that. Will update review if it spontaneously melts or explodes.    BTW, review is based on the price I paid for it. The price seems to fluctuate a lot so wait until a seller offers it for 10 dollars or less. Otherwise, it's pretty much the same deal as any other blow dryer."	1/29/2015

She timed her drying with this BABBPK2000 Xtreme Pink Edition and it took only.....wait for it.........5 minutes and her hair was shiny with no frizz. She HONESTLY WONT SHUT UP ABOUT IT. After she dries her hair she keeps telling me to look at it and see how there isn't any fuzz or frizz or whatever woman's hair gets like. HEY FELLAS, IF YOUR WIFE, GIRLFRIEND OR WHATEVER NEEDS A NEW HAIR DRYER THEN GO WITH THIS ONE. HAPPY WIFE/GIRLFRIEND HAPPY LIFE.

After reading all the great reviews raving about the quality of the hair dryer I was somewhat disappointed with it.. It's really powerful, I think even to the extent that it can over-dry and damage certain type of hair if one is not careful, so I'm sure it will dry hair in a shorter period of time, but I still have doubts about it being ceramic and using ionic diffuse technology which makes hair less frizzy and damages less, as I found no mention of it on the hair dryer, the box itself or the paper insert that comes with it.  The hair dryer has somewhat cheap and plastic feeling.. the seams are somewhat poorly made- they scratch your hand when you touch them, and the cold shot button is not a real button per se, it's a piece of plastic hanging there, which I think can get stuck in or broken after some use.. Anyway, it's an OK hair dryer for the price, very powerful, deserving the title Professional, but somewhat cheaply made.. I guess it makes it easier to write raving reviews about a product if you don't pay for it, but for the price you can get a little less powerful but higher quality product"	2/24/2015

"I have to be completely honest in saying that, I don't understand why this hairdryer is solely being marketed towards men. It's a nice hairdryer and does the same job like hundreds of other hairdryers on the market. Outside of the sporty color that may seem more masculine or the fact that it's inscribed with MANGROOMER on the side of it doesn't change the functionality of the dryer itself. I would have to say that this is psychological advertising at its best! I am a woman and my favorite color in the whole wide world is red which attracted me to this hairdryer plus I needed a new one so I was very happy to get this one! My husband thinks the dryer is ugly. He has never used a hairdryer on his hair because he wears his hair close to the scalp or completely bald. I will admit that this is one of the best hairdryers that I have ever used. It is more powerful than the hairdryer that I just recently tossed into the trash. It drys my hair quickly unlike my other hairdryer.  It is also very sturdy.  I have accidentally dropped the hairdryer on several occasions and there is still not one dent, ding or scratch on the Mangroomer at all. It is definitely built like a man LOL!"	3/14/2012

I guess that three years is probably not terrible for the life of a hair dryer, but for something used less than five minutes a day my wife was expecting better. About a year ago it began making an extra noise when it was infrequently switched to high speed, so she really limited that use. Anyhow, right at the three year anniversary of its first usage, the propeller<br />blades disintegrated and jammed the motor causing it to begin smoking and smelling really bad before she could get the plug pulled.

We loved the fact that these fit nicely on the wall, are easy to access and keep the bathroom organized.  However, both hair dryers shorted out and you could see sparks inside the barrell when turned on.  The second one had smoke rising from it and continued to emit noises after we unplugged it.  These hairdryers were only lightly used by adults and were not dropped or mishandled.  The first time it happened, we figured it was just bad luck, but not the 2nd time.  There are several other reviews for hairdryers from this company that report similar malfunctions.  We won't be buying a 3rd time and will try another wall mount brand that hopefully isn't as hazardous."	4/23/2014

"I was definitely skeptical of paying this much for a hair dryer, especially one with a brand that I have never even heard of making hair dryers.  But the reviews were good so I decided I'd give it a try. I had really high expectations and they were definitely met! I LOVE this hair dryer. I have wavy/curly hair and usually when I blow dry it, it gets really frizzy, this blow dryer gets rid of at least 75% of that friziness, if not more. And the diffuser it comes with is amazing! Another plus, is that it is soooo much quieter than any other blow dryer I've ever had!!"	3/25/2015

"We found this at a local store just looking for a cheep hair dryer, and I have to say that I am incredibly impressed with its performance. We have had this running for a minimum of three hours straight and it hasn't skipped a beat! First time we used it, we forgot to press the cool air button and ended up melting PVC pipe, so as far as heat goes, this thing is awesome. Its heat resistance is also pretty impressive! We have had it right up next to  about 1200° F and it kept working (it had a bit of distance from the heat since we connected it to PVC pipe, but the PVC funneled heat right into the dryer when it was off). Today we even had it next to about 1300° F and not a thing went wrong! So all in all we have ran this in pretty intense environments and it hasn't failed us yet. We've ran it 4 times like this and it was able to preform perfectly each time. Only problem we had was that at around hour 2 the first time we used it, the back started to smoke. We thought that maybe we had bought a cheep dryer and that we'd need a different one, but soon after it stopped and hasn't done it since. We were using it in a small drizzle which might impact performance, so don't use it for 2 hours in a slight drizzle. Once it started really raining, we moved into a garage and continued using it, and after that it stopped smoking. But all in all I'd say that it is a very good purchase for a low price. Once ours busts I will most likely purchase another Revlon."	6/29/2015

I took this on a vacation with me, and it fit pretty well in my backpack, where I only traveled with a carry on bag.  There are only two settings, but it gets the job done.  I have used full size blow dryers that don't nearly come close to how powerful of a blast this one provides.

It has all the features:  More heat, at 1875 watts  ---  Salon quality motor - up to 40% more air flow and three times the service life  ---  Ceramic pearl technology (Ceramics for even heating, and infused with crushed pearls which transfer to hair)  ---  Ionic generator to bathe hair with positive ions  ---  Concentrator and diffuser blower attachments  ---  Three heat settings, two fan speeds, and a cool shot feature.<br /><br />I don't use hair dryers.  My wife does, and when she broke her old Remington T/Studio, she would have nothing but another T/Studio as a replacement.  By the way, this dryer has a 4 year warranty, so keep your receipt.  (In our case, the dryer was about 2 years old but we no longer had the receipt, and the breakage was due to her dropping it and the fan speed switch physically broke . . . so I appropriated the old dryer, wired the fan speed to permanent high and the old hair dryer now resides in my workbench to serve as my hot air gun when I need one).<br /><br />Not cheap, but a very high end dryer and worth the price for us.  By the way, the Amazon price was by far the best we could find at the time we bought this replacement."	1/12/2015

"I got this hair dryer for mom because her carpel tunnel syndrome had been acting up and her hair dryer had become too heavy for her. This hair dryer is TINY! Don't be fooled by it's size though, very powerful for a low-watt dryer. It's actually kept her hair healthier from the low watts, though her drying time has remained the same. It's also the perfect travel size hair dryer. Heck, it fits in her purse! I liked it so much I bought one for myself as well. It does not come with a 'cool shot' setting, which I thought would make achieving curls more difficult. The attachments are tiny as well, so the air does not diffuse much as a regular size hair dryer does. However, because the size is so tiny and light weight it makes styling so much easier and therefore our hair looks better than ever!

At 75db it is perfect and it is a lower frequency as well which helps keep it quiet.<br /><br />I also love the Ionic technology. My husband & I were a bit skeptical about this feature, but now that I've tried it I'm a believer! With the Ionic generator turned OFF my hair does gain volume but it also tangles really easily. With the Ionic Generator turned ON the tangles disappear and my hair gets really smooth and soft! It's also helping with my split ends.<br /><br />The 3 heat seatings are great too! I believe the manufacture claims the lowest setting is a cool 62°F and the hottest is approximately 223°F. It gets really hot, but it's great that you can use the cool shot feature to &#34;set&#34; you style when done.<br /><br />Bottomline: quietest dryer I've ever used and totally worth the money too!"	4/30/2014

"I have been using drugstore brand (revlon, clairol, etc) hair dryers for years.  Recently, I found that no matter what brand I bought, the heat would go from hot to cold and the dryer took forever to dry my hair.  I decided to upgrade to a higher end dryer and am so thankful I did.  This dryer cuts the drying time in half and my hair is not frizzy.  I just went away for the weekend and every single one of my girlfriends asked to borrow my hair dryer and are now buying one.<br /><br />The dryer is a bit heavier than the drugstore brands but it's also twice as powerful.  The buttons do take a minute to get used to, but after a day they shouldn't be an issue anymore.<br /><br />I (and my girlfriends) would recommend this hair dryer to anyone.

It actually kicks when you start it, that's how much air rushes out of the nozzle. The warm air drying field - because of the dryer's unusual strength - is wider and more focused than any other that I've tried. The controls are remarkably easy to use. They require hardly any pressure, seeming to respond instantly when pressed. Ergonomically the Remington Ac2015 is well designed, fitting in my hand quite comfortably. Other hair dryers are often indifferently designed, their weight soon tiring your hands and arms requiring constant switching between left and right hands. This dryer stayed in my right hand without cramping or fatigue, which I really appreciate.<br /><br />The three heat settings and two speeds are perfect for the subtle changes your hair undergoes during the drying process. There's a big difference between the extremely wet hair you confront when first leaving the shower and the dryer, more responsive hair you have after a couple of minutes of drying. With the different heat settings and two speeds - coupled with the dryer's strength - I manage to avoid some of the heat damage that I used to inflict on my hair. Back then, I was forced to crank-up my inferior dryer in order to get better (and quicker) drying. Heat damaged, overly dry (even dessicated) hair is unmanageable and very unsightly. I am thankful those days appear to be gone for good. The attachments are easy to add and use though I never need them, finding the dryer in its native state to be best for my hair. The dryer runs quietly and without sparking, something that can be worrisome when your hands are moist. There's a four year warranty which indicates the confidence the manufacturer has in this well-made dryer. The Remington Ac2015 is an excellent professional grade dryer that is easy to recommend."	1/20/2011

The Conair has only two setting (high and low) and did not come with any accessories.  So going from the Conair to the Panasonic Nanoe was like upgrading from a basic to a state-of -the-art hair dryer.<br /><br />The Panasonic Nanoe comes with a quick-dry nozzle, a set nozzle and a diffuser. It boasts 3 temperatures settings--hot, warm and cool, and a choice of strong (high) or gentle (low) airflow.  What makes this hair dryer special is that it produces nanoe or invisible water particles that cling to your hair as you dry it.<br />I have thick hair that reaches to my shoulders and when I used the Panasonic, I had the impression that strands of hair were separated. It boosted my hair's natural volume and gave it more movement. And my hair felt softer too after I used the Panasonic with the quick-dry nozzle and the diffuser.  My sister who has long fine hair also agreed that this dryer seemed to give her hair more volume too.<br /><br />Since I've been handling a mini dryer for years, it took a bit of time to get used to the full-sized Panasonic. At first it felt heavy, especially when I attached the diffuser to it, and therefore was somewhat awkward to manage.  However, I'm getting used to its weight and size and therefore doing a better job at styling my hair with it.  The Panasonic Nanoe does emit a smell, but according to the operating instructions booklet, it is normal and harmless.<br /><br />I'm glad I got this hair dryer. I like having the different temperature settings, especially the cool one because I want to avoid heat damage.  With my old dryer, I didn't have any other choice but hot.  After using an attachment with the hot setting, it may be warm to the touch so handle with care if you need to switch nozzles.  This is a great hair dryer. I don't quite understand the fine details behind the Nanoe technology, but these invisible particles certainly make my hair look good."	11/30/2014

That had been the best hair dryer I had owned, and the American market doesn't have any (nothing of the same quality at least) as the one I'd had. So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement. I did a search for the same brand and several Panasonics came up. Panasonic in Japan makes great quality products so after a little searching and looking through reviews I ordered this model - mainly because of the adjustable styling brush AND it was dual voltage (I'd hate to have to get a voltage converter for something that is everyday use). This hair dryer is way better than the one I'd had for so long and I love it! Great for styling my bangs and giving my layers a little bit of body and slight curl at the ends. I would highly recommend this product to ladies who hate having to try and style their hair with a traditional blow dryer and a round brush."	2/5/2013

"I purchased this dryer before a trip to India. I used it for a couple of weeks in the US at the 120 V setting and then for about 4 weeks in India at the 230 V setting. It seemed to be working fine and I was happy.<br /><br />However when I came back to US and reset the voltage to 120V, that's when the thing started acting up. It was way too noisy, overheated so much that it stopped working all together!! Well, at that time my hair was about half dried and straightened, with the other half wet and beginning to curl... So I had no option but to somehow get this thing working again! I reset it, gave it a few minutes to cool down and tried again on the low heat setting... It was ok and I completed drying my hair..<br /><br />The next time I used it, alternating between high and low heat, it seemed to be fine... The time after that, it overheated again and I finally gave up on it... Its no use investing even $20 in this piece... It has only 2 heat settings without a cold shot button, doesn't work consistently every time... And if you change the voltage settings, it doesn't work properly! Cheap piece, do not invest any time and money in this!!!"	1/30/2013

My hair retains water and usually takes a long time to dry but this hair dryer does it faster.  I use this hair dryer every day and will order another for my beach house.

Even with the heaviness, which I associate with quality for some reason. It's a comfortable dryer and feels good in the hand without fatiguing it, despite the weight. In the past, I've had the problem of my long hair getting sucked into the dryer. I did not have that issue with this dryer. The one minor complaint I have is that the hot setting didn't feel as hot as I would have liked. The hot feels like more of a medium setting to me so it look a bit longer than I'm accustomed to to dry my hair. As far as the ceramic/ionic nature of the dryer, I'm not fully sure how this works with a blow dryer since it doesn't actually touch the hair like a flat iron or curling iron. The science has been lost on me.<br /><br />This comes with a spot dryer attachment and a diffuser attachment but I don't normally use those.<br /><br />Overall a great dryer."	11/4/2013

Being a senior with less arm and shoulder strength  I Love the lightness... I found it easier to handle because it has a shorter snout...but, It's almost too powerful for my new short hair. Recently had to change to a shorter style and a soft perm because of some shoulder impending surgery. Now, wish it included a diffuser.  Before surgery, I used a curling brush and dryer for styling.  Can't wait to heal and get back to pre-perm and curling brush then I'll  really be able to use the power of this new dryer.<br /><br />Update: Five months later.  Shoulder has healed. Perm is history! Using just curling brush and dryer, I have no problems holding this dryer over and behind my head. The dryer is easy to handle, its well balanced, but quite a strong blow for short hair...and its pretty loud! Wish it had another setting for less power.<br /><br />I like it well enough that I purchased another, at Costco, just like it to have as a spare."	3/24/2013

"so glad I purchased this one, so many options out there, but I didn't want to spend a lot, so I choose this based off the reviews, so glad I did. it works great, is super fast compared to all other driers ive had, which is many, and I love the ion, I wont buy one without it, and can tell a difference with ion! if you hold in the blue button it will give you cold air, which is great, you don't have to change the switch to cool air, just hole in the blue button on any setting! GREAT! it gets hot, but not so hot that it burns your neck (or my daughters neck, which is always a problem with the girls, she used to hate the hair dryer cus it was so hot it burned her neck ect), however it is hot enough to dry hair very quickly, which is a great deal for her, since that was her other problem with them. and its great for me too, since a lot of time I barely have time to even halfway dry my hair, now I can fully dry it in that amount of time! it is easy to hold/handle, and has all the options that an expensive dryer would, with the add ons (2 different ones!), they clip on and off easy also! it is sturdy, I have had it for a couple months, and I am very rough with them, leave them in the bathroom, laying out, or tucked beside the makeup table, laying in floor, or just through under the cabnit,, and I have had no issues at all, it doesn't have a scratch on it! amazing! i would recommend this to everybody, my sis already got the same one, after using mine,since she loved it, and still does after a month, and now my mom has the same one as well, and we all bought them on here, to be sure it was the exact same one, since in the stores it gets kinda confussing since so many are similar but not the exact same! so, yes, recommended, love it, love it , love it!"	3/28/2013

It is much lighter than all but one I picked up (a turquoise coloured model that looked too cheap despite the high price tag).  I used it for the first time tonight...it is MUCH quieter, and to all the reviewers who were confused about the reason for the lower decibels...its to protect the hearing of the USER. (not the family of--sorry).  At first I thought the dryer was not strong enough but it is missing that crazy blast of undirected air that just throws your hair every which way but it is definitely a strong current and very hot (variable temp) I used it on medium which was plenty hot.  I believe it is PRO (can get hotter than my last model).  Also the COOL SHOT is actually cool, most models give you slightly cooler...this one is definitely the &#34;coolest&#34;.

Static was a big issue, so when shopping for a blower with high wattage, high heat (yes, I want HOT) and high velocity, I found this one hoping it would meet the requirements. I found it to be like most of the drug-store blowers in my blower-graveyard in the closet, going to the next garage sale. I just did not meet the expectations, not enough blow, heat and I still had frizzy static hair. It works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don't want to damage, but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style. I did move on and purchased Onei MK-II for about $70 taking a really big chance. It blew me away literally and exceeded all expectations.

The fan can be set to low and high.  The fan moves lots of air.<br /><br />Even an 80's era, big hair band could save time with this product.  That kind of hair needs to be washed, rinsed, washed again and then heavily conditioned.  The conditioner softens the hair and forces it to accept massive amounts of water.  This increased water volume must be removed prior to styling or the hair will just sit there flat - like a poorly tuned guitar.  Pull the Conair 225NP from the holster, point it at the hair and get started.  The powerful DC fan moves lots of air to force its way into that mop head of hair and push the water out.  The three heat settings provide complete control over the speed of the drying process.

"This is a very good blow dryer. It has three heat and two speed settings, and a cool shot button to help set your style. It's 1875 watts- so it's nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster. But my hair has been getting split ends and damaged, so I love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage. Only time will tell if that feature works, but I sure need it. This also has the usual attachments that I never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer. My biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter (which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat). So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly.<br /><br />My hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington. My favorite part about the design is it's comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it's super lightweight. Also, this dryer is not as loud as most others. It looks great in purple too. I do wish the cord was a little longer. It's long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom, but if I need to use a lower outlet in another room  then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair (though adequate if I sit down). I'm used to a longer cord, so others may not mind the cord length, but I'm taking one star off as I think the cord should be at least a foot longer. Overall, however, I definitely recommend this hair dryer as it has great features, works very well and is such a great value!"	8/15/2015

PROS:   *** It is gentle and easy to use on very hard to reach places.     CONS:   *** After about 2 years of use the button broke, stuck in the depressed position, meaning I can no longer turn the thing on.   *** Its great for soft body hair, not great for anything above the neck.     REVIEW: Initially this seemed like a great purchase, it shaves reasonably close but at no danger of nicking the skin no matter what awkward angle you use. It seems simple and sturdy and easy to clean. No one wants details as to where and how this product was used, but I will say if you're hoping for a multitasking razor this isn't it. I would occasionally use this guy to trim my beard when I had one, and it worked okay, but sometimes snag the larger hairs, needed multiple passes, etc. This isn't a big deal, I think you need the right tools for the job and prefer this being a good body hair trim and sub-par beard trimmer than having something that was average at both.     What really lost stars was the product's history of breaking through no fault of the user. Unfortunately, even though it feels pretty sturdy and reliable it WILL end up breaking. Now I know nothing last forever, but I think for an electronics device that costs $40 that one only gently uses for a few minutes every week, it should be functional or repairable for more than a couple years.     Sadly Norelco is the only company that makes body hair razors that seem to work well, so I replaced my broken trimmer with a more expensive one hoping it lasts longer. I don't feel good, though, about endorsing Norelco with a repeat purchase."	7/2/2011

So I bought this hair dryer as my main hairdryer at home. I typically use the WARM setting. Overall, great finish and works very well. Despite me using the warm (not hot) setting, the thin film of plastic over the barrel and handle slowly started to peel off. Not a big deal, but definitely worth noting, in case that bothers you. It's doesn't look so pretty now, and I've had it for about a year.<br /><br />Overall, great value for the money and excellent results, but the packaging I'd give a 4/10, they could have done better."	3/13/2015

Great dryer for the price and my wife and are are happy that we have a new hairdryer that we know will last a long time (as long as I stay away from disassembling it).

I purchased this hair dryer to travel abroad.  I tested it at home as soon as it arrived at 110 Volts/ US and I loved it.  I was impressed at how powerful the HIGH speed setting was for a travel hair dryer.  Since I was headed to Europe I switched to 240 Volts and put it inside my suitcase. Once I arrived at my hotel I was very disappointed to find out, that once you switch to 240V you cannot flip the power switch to HIGH, you must try to dry your hair on the LOW setting which is no better than the hotel hair dryer. At first I thought it was just bad luck and went to try out my daughter's dryer ( I purchased two of these dryers since I was traveling with four teenage girls).  Their's did the same.  You can verify this at home, just put it on 240V and try to switch it to high with the dryer unplugged, you'll see that the switch won't move.  You can only go from OFF to LOW. If you are happy with the power at the LOW setting and your hotel doesn't provide a hair dryer, them this is better than nothing, otherwise don't even bother taking up space in your suit case to carry this dryer, you are better of just using the one the hotel provides."	7/24/2014

"First used this hairdryer model in a hotel room last fall and loved it. My own hairdryer finally gave out so I had the opportunity to buy this, very happy with it. Retraction of the cord works very well compared to my previous one, and I feel like I have less frizz after drying my hair with this one, probably because it has the diffuser at the end. Even on the highest setting it's not too hot."	7/16/2015

"I am not one to buy an expensive hair dryer, but this Panasonic with Nanoe technology is worth every penny.  The quality is self-evident when you open the package and pull out this professional sized hairdryer.  Although it looks like it would weigh a lot, it is surprisingly light and easy to handle. The controls are simple on the handle, with one side of the switch for temperature, cool, warm, and hot.  The other switch is for high or low air flow, yielding 6 possible combinations.  The Nanoe comes with three nozzles, which slip onto the front of the dryer.  The Set Nozzle for precise styling, the Quick-dry nozzle for drying hair quickly and the Diffuser for creating full bodied hair with volume and styling.  The is also a Cool Shot button on the handle to temporarily turn of the heat, to allow time to style.  The dryer comes with a heavy duty 9 foot cord with a safety overheating/reset plug.<br /><br />The Panasonic has Nanoe technology, which takes moisture from the air and your hair and puts moisture rich particles, small enough to penetrate your hair shafts.  That's quite a mouthful.  What it did for my hair was make it soft and silky, and I can see nuances in the color which I didn't notice before.  The blonde is blonder, the brown is richer.  My hair dried quickly and quietly, none of the loud buzzing in my ear.  As I run my fingers through my hair, there is none of that dry, frizzy, overblown feeling with my lower priced dryers.<br /><br />For results like this, you need to make an appointment at a salon.  If this is in your budget, highly recommended."	11/18/2014

"I haven't owned a blow dryer in over three years. I chopped off all my hair (I had about 1/2&#34; of hair left) to go chemical-free. Now, three years later, my hair is super thick and well past my shoulders again. I'm able to let my hair air-dry, but sometimes even after 24 hours, my hair isn't fully dry. I was excited to get this blow dryer to review on my blog. Sure, air-drying is less time-consuming and I'm able to do other things while my hair dries, but NOW I know what I was missing when I didn't need a hair dryer!<br /><br />If I have my hair styled and I get in the shower, I can guarantee my curled hair will be wet. A wet curl doesn't look good on anybody! With this blow dryer, I can quickly dry my all my hair or just a section because it comes with a concentrated air flow attachment. The buttons are self-explanatory. You have the cool blast button, the degree of heat button, and the force of air button. They are easy to press and easy to remember where they are when the blow dryer is up in the air against my hair.<br /><br />Since this is the first blow dryer I've owned and used since late 2011, I give it two thumbs up. It's a great blow dryer for the price you pay. It feels natural in my hands, and again, this is after not handling one in over three years. (Christmas 2015 will be my 4th year.)"	1/15/2015

(I know … I know … it’s the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it … I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.<br /><br />This review compares the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer, and this one (Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer).<br /><br />All of them have:<br />  * Same wattage<br />  * Three heat settings<br />  * Two speed settings<br />  * Cool shot feature<br />  * Diffuser and concentrator attachments<br />  * Ionic technology<br />  * Ceramic technology<br />  * Hanging loop<br /><br />The Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn’t say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.<br /><br />The Revlon’s concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington’s fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It's hot to put it back on.<br /><br />All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say “may” because the difference wasn’t large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.<br /><br />The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it’s the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.<br /><br />I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.<br /><br />I’ve yet to try the diffusers. Whenever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That’s the whole point of going curly – not having to do any hair drying. As for noise – I can’t answer which one is quietest because I’m deaf. It’s not a good idea to wear hearing aids while drying wet hair. :)<br /><br />The winner? The Remington DC because it takes the least amount of effort to use and produces the same results as the others. The T|Studio is just too heavy and the Revlon doesn’t perform as well as the DC.<br /><br />Update November 16, 2015: I downgraded the dryer from 5 stars to 3 stars because the heating element is giving out. It has been getting as hot in the last couple of weeks. When I switched back to an older dryer, I could see a big difference.

The lint filter is very nice, too.  Since purchasing it about a month ago it has performed flawlessly.<br /><br />A small &#34;con&#34; is that the mounting bracket has &#34;play&#34; and the unit does not feel solidly mounted even though the mounting bracket is very tightly screwed into the wall.  To remedy this, I cut a Styrofoam cup into strips and wedged pieces between the dryer and the wall.

I love the travel smart conair 1200 watt for traveling. It is small and packs easily. The wattage is easily changed for travel abroad. It actually had two speeds when I used it in Europe.

It's not too loud, fairly lightweight, ergonomic, great colors, and my favorite part of all-- the attachments actually stay on. I had another Conair that I loved, except that the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment would regularly fall off while I was drying my hair, and then it was burning hot, so I couldn't put it back on until after I was already finished drying. This one stays on and rotates securely.<br /><br />I can't pretend I notice a difference in my hair texture. It's always frizzy, especially in summer, and this didn't seem to cure that... but it works as well as my much more expensive hairdryers (I bought a professional one from a salon years ago) at a fraction of the price.

"I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a new blow dryer because I don't straighten my natural hair too often. I read a lot of reviews before deciding to buy this Conair blow dryer. OMG!!!! =D   I am a Black woman with very thick, curly/frizzy, coarse, mid-back length hair and it always takes a long time (~1-2 hours) and a lot of energy to blow dry my hair, even at the salon! But NOT with THIS DRYER!!! I cannot believe it. I've only had it for a month now, but I'm thinking that there isn't a better blow dryer out there for the price. I parted my damp hair into 4 quadrants and used the comb attachment included. It only takes 4-6 passes from the scalp to the ends of each entire section to be completely dry and straight. And it feels so smooth and soft. Unheard of for me. I almost don't need to flat iron afterwards. Seriously!   My daughters and nieces will be getting these as gifts from me this year.  ;D I am VERY happy with this purchase."	1/17/2010

"I looked for months to find a hair dryer that had 3 heat settings (low, med, high) AND 3 actual fan speeds (low, med, high). It drives me crazy that manufacturers include OFF as a fan speed when in my mind, off is the lack of speed.<br /><br />Anyway, this hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for. I've been using it for a couple weeks now. I wanted to get some uses under my belt before I wrote a review. The review is long but I'm trying to cover all the topics.<br /><br />Fan Speeds:<br />High: It's a good high speed but not one that will blow you into the next room. I'd compare it to a high speed found on a good quality salon dryer.<br />Med: FINALLY!!! A real medium speed. I have very fine hair. It was hard for me to use 2 speed dryers because usually the low was too low and took forever to dry my hair and the high would make me look like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. The medium speed was enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time and allow me to style it.<br />Low: A reasonable low speed. Good for curly hair to keep it from frizzing.<br /><br />Heat Settings:<br />High: Certainly hot but not so much that it burned my fingers or scalp when drying.<br />Med: This is the setting I use most. It has enough heat to dry my fine hair quickly without causing it to look damaged.<br />Low: Nice to use for curls or a slower, more refined dry style.<br /><br />Noise level: Much quieter than I thought it would be. I have some more expensive dryers that I'd like to wear ear plugs with. Even my boyfriend commented on the lower sound.<br /><br />Buttons/Controls: Some people have commented on the stiffness of the slide adjustments. Are they stiff? A bit. But honestly, I'd rather them that way. The slide controls for the fan and heat are right where you are going to hold the dryer when using it. In my opinion, they need to be stiff so you don't move them accidentally when you are using the dryer. Nothing I hate more than drying my hair only to have my thumb hit a switch to high and blast myself on accident. I have arthritis in my hands and fingers but I don't find the slides hard to move. It just takes a deliberate motion to move them up or down. The cold shot button is easy to push in and not difficult to hold for longer periods if you need to.<br /><br />Attachments: It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment. Both function quite well. They snap in, so no falling off while you're using them. The push buttons used to detach are easy to push.<br /><br />As a whole:<br />This dryer is a fantastic buy! I'm going to order another one to keep as a back up. The cord has a nice little strap to keep it bundled up if you need to travel with it or store it. The 3 real fan speeds and heat settings are what you would expect them to be. It doesn't get hot on the exterior when you use it and it won't blow out your eardrums either which gives it a big thumbs up in my book. The color seems pretty close to what is pictured on Amazon's site; it's nice, but I really didn't buy it for looks. It dries hair quickly and without causing frizz. There was no buyers remorse with this guy. It was well worth the time I spent looking and well worth the money I paid.switch to high and blast myself on accident.

"I loved the idea of a hair dryer with a retractable cord, and I have always had success with Conair in the past, so I was so disappointed when I started using the Cord Keeper and found it was just too loud to use.  I literally had to put my finger in my left ear to keep it from crackling when I used this dryer.  I mentioned that I had to take a hair dryer back to the store when my son and daughter-in-law were visiting, and they said they had a hair dryer that was too loud too.

"So one day I forgot my Revlon RV484 dryer when I went to the gym. No problem since there are communal hair dryers I can use.  That day I found out how underpowered this HD was compared to other 1875w dryers out there.<br /><br />My hair is thick with a slight wave to it.  I like to get it as straight and clean as I can.  I don't like frizz, I don't go crazy with styling, I don't do the 'just out of bed' look either. I had been using this dryer for a little over 2 years with the concentrator.<br /><br />While true enough, it did dry my hair and I could get it relatively straight (as long as it isn't very humid), it took quite a bit of time and fussing to get it that way.  And by the time I was done, I had a bunch of small hairs going every which-way on the top of my head that I would need to smooth over with product.<br /><br />If I needed my hair perfect, like if we were going out, that means I left it in a Turbie for 30-45 min instead of my usual day-to-day 10 min.  That way it comes out relatively straight with little frizz (again, dependant on humidity) I guess if you take that into consideration, this works fine if you have loads of time in the morning.  Me? I like my sleep.<br /><br />Now, the air was hot enough but the amount of air that was coming out was not, even on the high speed (which it was on for 2 years!).  I wish I would have figure that out back then and exchanged it for something else.<br /><br />There were two features on the dryer that I could not tell you what they do, they never seemed to work or show a difference in styling for me: the Ion switch and the cold air blast. My hair dried just as slowly with the Ion switch on or off and the cold air blast was never cold or room temperature, it always just felt like the hot air was coming out.<br /><br />My other complaint is the attachments for it.  The diffuser and the concentrator.  I think I used the diffuser once but it suffers from the same, if not a little more, complaint.  The attachments are held onto the dryer by a little hump of plastic.  With any force, they pop right out.  Very frustrating when you're trying to get the dryer and a brush through your hair and the concentrator keeps popping off and falling on the floor.<br /><br />I did like the rubber hook on the base of the dryer, it came in handy for hanging the dryer on the side of my vanity when not in use (before I started packing it for the gym).  And the whole thing is light enough.lastic.  With any force, they pop right out.

"I've tried the more expensive ones out there, including the Gold n' Hot (on  wheels & the bonnet dryer).  My hair never got dry in the back and in the crown area when using the Gold n' Hot dryers.  For years I used the Conair HH320LB Pro Styler Bonnet Dryer, and my hair dried very quickly.  When mine finally conked out after about 10 years of use, I went to Walmart to purchase a new one; and to my surprise, they no longer carried them.  I went to Sally Beauty Supply, Target, and other Beauty Supply Stores...no success.  Finally, I thought &#34;Amazon--bet I can find it there.&#34;  Sure enough, there it was!  I ordered it immediately!  I love the fact that this dryer has the option to open and close the vent on the top of the hood which is where other dryers lack.  I keep the vent closed for fast drying.

They also state that the dryer is using 'ionic technology' which 'promotes healthy, shining hair while fighting frizz'.<br /><br />One distinct feature is the 'folding handle'. You can twist it (careful or you can break it) in a way that turns the handle parallel with the body and therefore makes it easier to pack when traveling. It's also easier to store it in a drawer when not traveling.<br /><br />The 4 year warranty is quite good when compared with what you get for similarly priced electronics. First, it's 4 YEARS which is not bad. Second, even if you can't produce a receipt, they promise to honor the warranty based on the unit's manufacture date. You are going to pay for shipping to the service center and include $7 to have the unit shipped back. And, of course, they will not cover any damage that you may inflict.<br /><br />There are no 'negatives' I detected.

The product is wonderful when it works but my Amazon order history shows it is a consistent failure (purchases on Jan 3, 2012, Mar 5, 2013, May 20, 2013, Jun 19, 2017) of the same feature. There was at least one other failure but I complained directly to the manufacturer about the short lifespan in 2013 and was sent a new one and also bought another new one at a local store and these two lasted 4 years, 2013-2017.<br /><br />Some people may ask why I keep buying this product and I will say, 1) it is inexpensive, 2) a few of these units have lasted for more than one year, 3) the 3 holes on my bathroom wall where it is mounted are difficult to disguise and each replacement unit so far has fit into these holes (although I now use a slightly larger drywall anchor) and, 4) I like having a hair dryer off my counter!<br /><br />Original comment: I purchased this hair dryer more than a year ago and used it nearly every day to dry both my husband's and my own short hair.  It is a reasonably quiet but powerful machine that does its job well.  The addition of a hanger on the wall mount to wrap the cord out of harms way, since it inevitably stretches out, is a great innovation.  I would have given it a 5-star review then.<br /><br />Unfortunately the lower speed (it has two speeds) stopped functioning after a little more than a year. The higher speed is too hot and too noisy to use.  I repurchased the exact same hair dryer on April 6, 2013.  Today--3 days AFTER the 30-day product replacement window--the lower speed stopped functioning.<br /><br />Updated 7/14/15:  The manufacturer replaced this hair dryer under their more customer-friendly policy but I had already bought a new one from Amazon so I stored it away.  Last week, more than two YEARS later, the new Amazon hair dryer quit (same reasons as before) and I was able to install the stored dryer in 10 minutes.  I urge Amazon customers to always consider invoking the manufacturer's warranty and remind everyone that being able to reprint the Amazon purchase record provides &#34;proof of purchase&#34; they needed to honor their own 1-year warranty.  I also  am upgrading this product to 4 stars because it continued to perform well for longer than many inexpensive electrical appliances these days and, obviously, I like the style and functionality enough to keep buying the same unit<br />I won't purchase a third one.  I downgraded my review to 3 stars because, when functioning correctly, it is still a very decent hair dryer.  The company needs to work on their quality control issues.air dryer quit (same reasons as before) and I was able to install the stored dryer in 10 minutes.

The spring loaded wind-up cord works well and has a powerful motor. I gave it a 4 Star rating for two reasons. 1) I think it's kind of heavy and 2) the slide switches are difficult to operate on the skinny handle. They may want to consider push buttons that lock and unlock as well as using some light weight manufacturing materials or new style servo on the next model. Yeah.... Chinese,  Right?<br />After using this hair dryer that I purchased on Nov 23 2013 as it turns our I was correct in my assessment of the cheap switches. They failed today August 27, 2017. You may argue that just south of 4 years is plenty for a hair dryer, I'm disappointed in this product. Many other hair dryer manufacture's produce a product that lasts twice as long.

I like that this hair drier is quiet. It has multiple heat settiing with a good high heat setting.  It is comfortable fit for my hand and not heavy which makes blow drying less toil some. Although not heavy it does not lack in quality and durability.  I have owned several dryers and refused to setlle for a poor quality. This is superior in quality performance and durability compared to the typical Conair brands.I have owned for several months now and have no complaints and works as well as the day I purchased  If looking for quite and quality I would recommend Remington.  Well worth it.	6/25/2013

It dries my hair fast, and makes my hair very shiny and straight.  I used to use Revlon hair drier from drug store which is about $15.  Revlon hair dryer usually stops working after one year from purchase and makes my hair very dry and unhealthy.  This Panasonic hair dryer is a little pricy compared to regular dryer you can get from drug store but you get what you pay for.  It's worth it.  The finish of the body prevents your fingerprints to stick even though you have hair cream or hand cream on your hand so you can keep the beautiful appearance of the dryer. I feel my hair has been healthier and shinier with this.  I highly recommend this product."	1/22/2014

"Updated Review: 4 months after installing this blowdryer, it died. I was super disappointed given my glowing review below. I have not even contacted Amazon or the manufacturer since it's past the 30 days. The wire below the handle started to heat up a little bit, I smelled smoke. At first thought it was my hair. But, the thing died shortly after. I have another blow dryer. Not sure if I received a lemon or if this is Andis quality. My past blowdryers from other reputable firms would last 7-10 years. 4 months was a HUGE let down  PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW:  Definite space saver. Quiet. Does the job. I feel the low setting is definitely very low, much lower than my travel blow dryer you can find at any drugstore. However, I like the higher setting. It's nice to wash, blowdry and head out. Makes my mornings much easier to have things in place and organized. This blow dryer comes with two long screws. You have to remove the baby screws on the plate on the back. I then marked the walls where the two holes are. The plastic anchors I did not use, because the frame/holder is super light weight. So is the dryer. It's nice. In addition, the green light makes a nice nightlight in the bathroom. Personally, I wish I could change the color to clear or blue. The photo they provide shows the cord hook is on the right side. There are two other sm/med size screws to hang the cord to either the left or right side. I prefer the right side; however it all depends on where you place it in your bathroom. It's a great product. They thought of almost everything on this dryer. The only two things I would change is to have even a more minimized holder (semi-translucent), optional colored dryers, retractable cord, small dryer, more powerful, cool air option dryer (i.e. fan with a hold button ;-), no cord but a chargeable blow dryer. I think that's about it."	2/1/2015

It dries my hair quickly and without frizz. (I have the ion generator on and use the concentrator.) Also the cord is a good length-about 5 1/2  to 6 ft. long. (The cord on my last hair dryer was way too short.) I would recommend this hair dryer.	12/23/2014

The first was a gift and I loved it! So when it broke after 8 months of 3xs a week use I didn't mind buying myself a new one. Then this one lasted less than 4 months! Just up and stopped working mid drying one day - thank goodness I had a back-up! I tried calling and emailing the customer service for Andis repeatedly and have been completely ignored! I used to recommend this brand to everyone because the drying capabilities are amazing and the product feels sturdy - but now I would STEER CLEAR. My last conair was only $35 too and lasted for 8 years! I would rather go with something reliable than Andis!	4/21/2009

"Has a good volume of air on high for a compact unit, but the trade-off is it is a bit noisy too.  Not mention in the listing, but the blue button is a cool air button and works as would be expected.  Unlike the Revlon Rvdr5033 I had the cool button on this unit just turns the heat off and back on when released and does not change the fan.  It gets very hot on high and so did the Revlon.  Too hot it seems to me but it appears no one makes a 1500 watt model anymore.  I could find nothing but 1875 watt models even in compact.  Not pictured or mentioned but this one like all of them has the huge block on the cord end with a GFI and AC plug as part of that block.  Even though they tell you not to put two GFI's on the same circuit and there hasn't been a house built in almost 40 years without a GFI covering any outlet in every bathroom the requirement for this still persists.  I like that you can easily take the cover of the fan in the rear for cleaning.  Not many of the compact models seem to have that feature.  Overall a good unit.  Time will tell how durable and long lasting it is.  I can only hope it is as good in that area as the one it replaced.  Update 7/21/15: Well it is NOT very long lasting.  About 4 months in it suddenly started smoking and got very hot very fast did some nice sparking and arcing, then quit.  We will see if they honor the warranty."	4/2/2015

"I bought this hair dryer to replace another Conair I had for many years.  After one year I am going back to my old one.  There is NO WAY to clean the vents on this one and it heats up HOT.  It burned the top of my ear the other day.  The retractable cord is a nice idea, but if it retracts too fast you end up with bruises from it hitting you in the arm.

I use hot rollers and my hair is thin so I have to be careful with products left on hair weighing it down.  Even with the regular hair spray my hair would look like helmot head..and would fall before I even went outside.  Outside, in the sun, would cake.    Anyway I read that the Sebastian products were amazing. So with high hopes I purcahsed the re-shaper with the mindset you could finger thorugh, etc.    I even went as far as spraying each section before I hot rolled it for the layered in hold.  Then spritzed all over when done.  Today, after I did this I had amazing curls, etc..  Didnt even leave the house just went into the other room which is my office.  IT is air conditioned so have not been outside yet.  The door bell rang less than 20minutes and I passed by the mirror and the hair has completely FALLEN!  This is after I layered every curl and sprayed entire head with re-shaper as a finisher.    What a disappointment.  My hair is sticky too.  Im not sure why the other poster said it stayed great even after finger combing.  Maybe because it was just a few hairs on her head (bangs).    My hair has fallen and left with the feeling of hair spray on my hair.      So, not sure what the hype was all about. I have never used hair spray so much and it did nothing.      Lastly, my fingers did snag quite considerably when I tried to comb my hair with my fingers behind my ear. Since the curls fell, I tried to put my hair behind my ears so it wouldnt be in my face and my fingers got caught in all the sticky mess.    What a disappointment"	8/5/2010

"After getting a couple shellac manicures I decided to invest in my own home manicure set up and this light works great for doing your own nails. Fits one hand or foot just fine and has 2/3/5 minute timers. I won't go past 2 minutes so don't see a need for the other two really. Item was packaged well, with all 4 light bulbs, very easy to install the light bulbs and wa-lah - good to go! I just could not see spending over $150 on one of these lights for home use so bought this one. It works the same as the one at my local salon with one exception - no fan. Maybe that's the additional cost of the higher priced one and someday I may decide to spend that kind of money, but for a 2 minute curing this light is great. If you are into the new gel or shellac style manicures to grow your own nails long and strong it's worth the investment! You'll spend the same amount of money in 2-3 months as you will on setting up your own home manicure kit. I do feel bad for my manicurist so I'll probably still go see her for pedicures!"	7/2/2011

My hair is still frizzy after use ( I always straighten after with any dryer ), however, it is less frizzy then with my old con-air ion dryer.

It is super lightweight, super small, about the size of a female's hand spread out, dries almost/ as fast as my Babyliss Toniro full sized dryer.  It is also cheap and comes with a little bag to put it in, though my baby has took it as her own along with the dryer!<br /><br />Edited: It does include a concentrator and a diffuser, though that diffuser is so small.

"I used the Infiniti by Conair 223F blow dryer on my 10 year olds hair. She has a head full of long blond hair but it is fine. Usually when I use a blow dryer on her hair it gets to be fly away and static filled. This blow dryer worked great on her hair. It left it looking smooth and with a nice shine. She didn't get the fly away messy look from it. I started out using the hot setting and then moved down to the warm setting as her hair was drying. She liked that I was able to use the cooler setting especially when blowing it on her face to dry her bangs. I love that the cord retracts back into the handle for storing. Makes it much easier to put away when done using it and also makes it nice while using it that you don't have to have a long cord dangling in your way. I don't mind the color, it actually looks more of a reddish purple to me than pink. The dryer is a little bulky for smaller hands. My daughter thought it was a bit heavy for her smaller hands but I had no problem hanging on to it and using it. Overall, a nice blow dryer that works well."	9/11/2009

But with the JF1, I had great results and a true cut down in the time I spent on my hair. And using the diffuser and on a medium setting, along with a heat protectant, I didn't feel as if I was frying my hair to death. At times, I have literally seen smoke arise from my hair using other blow dryers, even on a low setting.<br /><br />I highly recommend the JF1.

"OMG, I have been looking for this dryer for at least 5 years!  After my favorite dryer broke, I looked for one like it that is lightweight, has power but not too much power, and most importantly, has the high/low/off switch on the BACK of the dryer handle, not in the front.  All of the dryers I have looked at in the past have the switch(es) on the front of the handle.  This is a problem for me, because when I style my hair with a dryer and a round brush, I have to constantly turn the dryer on and off.  With the buttons on the back of the handle like this one, I can turn it on and off with one hand.  When the buttons are on the front of the handle, I have to set my brush down to turn it on and off with two hands.  What a hassle!  This lightweight dryer with the on/off switch on the back of the handle fits the bill perfectly.  I will probably buy another one as a back-up for when this one wears out.

This peel does an excellent job of exfoliating and is not over-drying like some alpha hydroxide peels. However, the concentration of alpha/beta hydroxides is relatively low compared to what you may get at a dermatologist. Even on my sensitive skin I did not get overly red or flakey. Additionally, this peel seems to helped with oil control on my oily skin-especially when used consistently over time.     I do have a few complaints, one is the smell. Although it is not over-powering it takes a bit of getting used to, it smells like the old lanse-sa treatments at the hair salon. Another complaint is I do suffer from acne and this product seems to aggravate acne problems if used during a break-out. A word of warning, this stuff is very difficult to get out of hair so be careful where you apply it.    With all that said it is a luxurious treatment that helps exfoliate skin in a way no exfoliating rinse can do, and helps with oil control. I have not noticed any dramatic wrinkle reduction or dark spots disappearing like the professional peels deliver."	7/2/2011

This is a great hair dryer and is a lot lighter than the clunky old one I used to have. It looks great and helps my morning routine go a lot faster. I am able to dry my hair quickly and I love the attachment that it comes with to be able to focus all the hot air on one section of hair at a time as I am brushing it out. When I use the attachment it makes my hair look a lot better as well than without using it. This is a powerful hair dryer it isn't the most powerful hair dryer I have ever seen but definitely a very good one. It is very powerful and dries my hair quickly which is awesome since I have really long hair. It is a nice sleek hair dryer so it fits nicely into my hair dryer holder and looks really nice as well. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.	3/1/2015

I'm looking to buy my own for convenience. My mother originally bought this dryer because it was used in a lot of Dominican salons and the fact that she's had it over 10 years I think speaks for itself. We didn't buy it on Amazon but, at a local beauty supply for about $60 then.  I wanted to leave a review because I felt that a lot of reviews I've seen for different dryers were left by people with hair types that could be dried well even without a hair dryer. Not so for me.<br /><br />My hair:<br />- Thick<br />- Coarse<br />- Long (past the middle of my back)<br />- Dominican (if that helps)<br />- Cannot air dry it (it would dry very puffy and frizzy if so)<br />- Has been relaxed (I relax it 2-4 times a year)<br />- Retains water (humid weather wreaks havoc)<br /><br />What seems to be most people's hair types in hair dryer reviews overall (not just this one):<br />- Able to dry with minimal effort (no brushing or able to point the dryer generally and have their hair still dry straight)<br />- Hair that can dry in 5-20 minutes with minimal effort<br />- Thick (though I think some people are confused as to their actual hair type)<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that this hair dryer is only 1300 watts. After reading many dryer reviews, I thought I'd need something that was 2000 watts. Now, I'm rethinking that because this still does a good job at 1300. I think some people who leave dryer reviews don't know their actual hair type and/or how to properly blow dry their hair for a smooth, lasting, straight finish. Sometimes it's not the dryer's fault but, HOW people attempt to dry their hair. My mother does hair very well (if you've ever gone to a Dominican salon, you know that Dominican salons tend to do hair well). Some people at other salons tend to dry all hair types as if they are the same and dry the same and that isn't the case, leaving me (or others Iknow with similar hair) with terrible results. These have been my experiences and obviously don't apply to everyone. I don't like going to salons and haven't gone in years. Using this dryer, I have always received compliments on how nice and straight my hair looks.<br /><br />When I first tried to do my own hair (without really knowing how to) using someone's John Frieda 1875 watt hair dryer. I did a horrible job that took me a very long time and ended with puffy hair, not smooth at all but at least dry. If you don't use a blow dryer on a hot enough setting, it will not dry well, it only gets the water out of your hair is all. My mother, using the same dryer, did a much better job similar to the results with this dryer.  You have to use a brush of some type (round or straight) to pull and straighten the hair for a smooth finish.  You should also dry only small sections at a time for better results and always point the dryer down and in the direction of the hair shaft using the concentrator nozzle. I use a thermal protector as well as other products for shine so, I can't comment on the dryer's efficacy on those things.<br /><br />PROS about this dryer:<br />- Takes my hair only about 40 minutes to fully dry (after just squeezing out excess water with a towel, parting, clipping and drying small sections at a time. Compare this to salons where I have to sit under a hooded dryer for well over an hour and have them still blow dry my hair straight after, which takes another 20 minutes or so for a total of almost two hours.)<br />- Dries smoothly and straightens well (no need to use a flat iron after)<br />- Gets very hot<br />- Strong air flow<br />- Good weight (not too heavy)<br />- Buttons are well placed (don't accidentally press anything)<br />- Long cord length (Haven't measured it exactly but, it is at least 6 feet, probably more and has never been an issue)<br />- Removable filter (can easily clean for a longer life)<br />- Durable (has been owned for at least 10years and still works well, using it several times a week on 2-3 people with similar hair types to my own)<br />- Comes with a concentrator nozzle (Stays put and after years of accidental drops has never broken)<br />- Could go for up to a week without having to redo hair<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Brand name rubbed off after many years (I don't care but, may be a con for some)<br />- Gets very hot (have to protect my ears sometimes and cannot leave it close to my scalp for long. Good that it gets that hot but, you have to be careful so it's a pro and con)<br />- Loud (I think most dryers are. In terms of hearing conservation, I would recommend using ear plugs with dryers since they are so close to your head/ears and are very loud for a long period of time. This could eventually result in some amount of noise-induced hearing loss. Not specifically with just this dryer but, any dryer.)<br />- Only has a hot and cool setting (each with different strengths. The cool setting isn't that cool, it is warm although I've only used it after using hot for over 30 minutes. This is only a con if you're looking for a dryer with a cool shot.)<br />- Somewhat expensive (there are many dryers available for half this price so it is an investment)<br />- Not compact (If you're looking for something like that. I have had bad experiences with hotel dryers that leave my hair a big puffy mess so I will still pack and use this, even though it is a full size hair dryer. It's that good.)<br /><br />I would recommend this product but, I am not personally buying it for myself because it is over my budget. I am looking for a dryer that is less than $40-50 and available through prime. This dryer is not available with prime shipping and the beauty supply store has jacked up the price over the years. If you can afford to spend that amount on a dryer, it is a good investment. I'd prefer not to if I can find something that works as well as this one for less money. If I do find something like that, I will definitely share that (I'm researching and will try) but, at least I have this dryer as a backup if anything."	3/29/2013

"I could kick myself for throwing away my old bonnet hair dryer twenty years ago.  It worked fine but blow dryers were more efficient.  I bet that if I still had it, I could plug it in and it would work much better than this model.  This model is such poor quality I'm shocked that someone would even sell it!  The unit is ok (after 3 uses) but the bonnet is so cheap that the plastic connector pulled away from the bonnet on the second use.  I suspect that the glue they use is not heat resistant and it melted, because it started to emit a chemical smell right before the plastic ring fell out of the bonnet.

The first one lasted about 3 month, the second one about 8 months.  I have another model from a different manufacturer in my bath and it has worked for over 10 years.  We purchased this one because of the claim to produce less noise (not really) and the night light.  The night light could be too bright for some, but it was OK for us.  I just order another wall mount from a different manufacturer.  In less than 1 year, I will be $120+ for one hair dryer.  Not good value.

I'm tell you all this because the keratin treatment is supposed to significantly reduce the drying time of your hair, and it does. So, while I did notice a shorter drying time with this dryer than with my other ones, it wasn't a really valid measure of how much better and faster it was, because any dryer is pretty fast for me now.    I decided to use the dryer on my daughter's long, thick, wavy hair. The unit got to be a bit heavy - it wasn't noticeable for my hair because it was such a short drying time (7 minutes?) but not as bad as many other full sized dryers that I've used. This one is a smaller unit, but it is loud. It did successfully dry my daughter's long hair in 1/3-1/2 the usual time. And, her hair was shinier and softer than with a regular dryer. I am assuming that's from the tourmaline and/or ceramic as we used the same conditioner's we've always used.

I don't have what people would call a thick head of hair and it took a long time for me to dry what I have.  The hair brush was flimsy and the bristles were mangled when I received it.  Another thing I didn't like was that it is quite heavy and the handle is long so it makes it seem even heavier when you are holding it.  I ended up returning it since it was pretty useless to to.	10/20/2014

My 5 year old dryer caught fire . After a few quick looks around my rural<br />town for  any kind of dryer,  (Dryers are dryers. Right?), and coming up empty,  I just went online and with little consideration except price, in 5 minutes I just clicked  the buy button & forgot about it.  When it arrived and I used it , it was a force!  My hair dryed  practically instantly and with added volume.  It has many buttons.  Not sure what all are for.  Can't read them without my glasses.<br />Just pushed them all until I get fastest & hotest.  I can use my round brush & this dryer and dry & style my hair faster than with any of my specialty  hair stylers. Just a few minutes. ( I have shortish hair)  I've got the &#34;Instyler&#34; $100+  & The Pefecter Fusion Styler $100+  & others.  I can't pinpoint why this one works better in lightening speed....

Beauty	5	23	23	N	Y	Best Wall Mounted Unit on the Market	"Right after I first encountered one of these units over 15 years ago in a California motel, I have bought and installed them in all three of our bathrooms.  I have used competitive designs in other motels, but find that this one is still the best, and is reasonably durable.  Based on my experience, I would guess that a unit is good for about 3,000 uses, at a cost therefore of about 1 cent per use (not counting the cost of electricity).  In addition to high  and low fan settings, It also has two power (heat) settings; 1200 Watts and 1500 Watts; I prefer the higher one. The unit is shipped with the 1200 Watt setting.  In order to set it to 1500 Watts, you must pry off the air intake cover to get to the hidden switch.  You can also hide almost any length of excess power cord in the raceway on the back of the unit.  You may need to experiment some and use some sharp U-turns to get the length just right for your situation. You should also pry off the air intake cover and vacuum out the air intake grill at least once each month to maintain good air flow, and to avoid tripping the overheat thermal protector. I use the little lever on a fingernail clipper as a pry rod.  It fits just right into the pry notch. I too liked the smaller and utilitarian design of the older model, but understand that most buyers prefer the ergonomic look of the new unit.  When you stored the older unit into a mechanical clip, it gave you an audible click to let you know that it was firmly in; the newer model uses a magnetic mount. You don't have to jam it in, but you do need to make sure the magnet has taken hold before you pull away your hand."	8/28/2014

I had a Remington for about 8 years and finally decided it was time for a new one.  I had never used a diffuser before as I have short hair and didn't think it would do too much for me.  Boy was I wrong.  My hair doesn't have this much volume unless I use a product in it!!  The cord wind is phenomenal!!!!  I always hated how my hair dryer took up half of my counter unless I unplugged it and stored it under the sink.  For something I use everyday, it never happened.  I thought I was going to have to be content with my dryer's cord all over the place until now!  When I am done using it, I simply hit the button and the cord goes away but the dryer is still plugged in:)  The only down fall is that the cord is not very long.  Luckily my outlet is right next to my bathroom counter!  I am very pleased with this dryer and would highly recommend it."	7/13/2009

I couldn't believe I had found such a great quality product for a great price. I was in the market for a new hair dryer but couldn't afford to spend an arm and a leg on a fancy blow dryer. I did a lot of shopping around and finally came across this one that even came with the attachments I was looking for. I bought it and was worried that for the price the product wouldn't be as described. I received it and it has 3 different heat settings and two different levels. It also came with the attachments which work great! This blow dryer is still going great a few months down the road. If you are in the market for a new hair dryer and want one that is functional I definitely recommend this product.	10/19/2014

Second purchase of this model.  First one lasted a few years until the cord didn't retract, and then something came loose and smelled chemically acrid.<br /><br />It moves air and dries fairly well.  No particular change in frizz-level compared to others.<br /><br />Temps are spot on with me; it's nice to know I won't get burned nor be frustrated by a too-cool warm.<br /><br />I've gotten out of the habit of electric drying both for ecological reasons and for noise/hearing damage.  The only person really bothered by my wet hair or the results if nature-dried is me.  I don't find it any louder than any of my previous dryers, but my DD hates it with a passion. I'm thinking about using it as punishment (not really, but I probably could).  I don't get it, though. That's how hair dryers sound.  She winced at a 1200W mini, too.<br /><br />My cord retracts just fine, not like a shade, but I'm glad to have the heftier/safer cord without a vicious, finger-eating spring.  it took hundreds of in-and-outs for my old one to give out.<br /><br />The switches could have benefited mightily with even a slightly a concave dragging surface.  This strikes me as an efficiency design that wasn't.  It's not intolerable, though. If it bothered me that much I'd glop some plastic adhesive on it to give it a thumb-knob or edges.<br /><br />I  &#60;3  love &#60;3  the surface. It's totally Lenovo (not cheap).  It's *great* (grippable) if you don't always use the handle (like when the handle is folded in).  That said, it's not makeup-friendly, or rather, it is.  Oily pigmented stuff shows up on this and can be hard to get really clean. 90% rubbing alcohol does the trick.  I still love it.<br /><br />My attachments stay on, tightly. (Save the rubber bands from your broccoli and wrap them around the dryer exhaust to increase its diameter.  Cram-like-heck the attachments onto the dryer.  There are other solutions, too. like flexing the tabs with  a screwdriver.)<br /><br />I'd say skip this, frankly.  Go for one with easier switches and a lower decibel output... at a higher price."	10/26/2014

"I got this dryer for my wife as she has fine, relatively delicate hair and every dryer she has ever used has made it dry and harder to manage (in the past I heard many complaints). Did this dryer fare any better? Well she hasn't had that problem with this dyer, and to me that's saying A LOT.<br /><br />John Frieda is a salon product label not an appliance manufacturer, but they seem to have chosen quite well the bathroom appliance to put their name on. It's well designed, attractive, and (most importantly) well-built and effective as what it's designed to be used for. As my wife is the hair-care expert I relied on her expert experience with this device for the bulk of the info for this review. But for the record, here's my two cents: Her hair looks less damaged, smoother and softer, has less split ends, and in general looks healthier with use of this device. The only downside I can see is that it IS a bit large. Now on to her opinions...<br />The number one thing my wife said she likes about the dryer is the ample number of heat and speed settings. These allow you to customize the dryer to your specific hair texture in order to dry your hair as quickly as possible, with the least damage done. It also has a cold shot button, a feature she would like better if it had a lock. It gets tiring trying to hold the button continually.<br /><br />She also likes that it comes with three attachments (a diffuser and two concentrators). These are made of sturdy plastic, and are very easy to snap on and off the nozzle. However, they do heat up very quickly during use so switching between them while blow drying can be a little uncomfortable. The device also has a nice long power cord which is convenient.<br />The only really `con' with this dryer would be its size. We have very limited storage space in my bathroom and this dryer takes up a lot of space. However, considering everything else this dryer has to offer it's not a deal breaker in the least. I would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a fast and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair. It's an excellent value for a great price. Well done John Frieda!and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair.

There is a screw for you to change the voltage. It's almost as powerful and heats up like a regular dryer, which is a huge plus for me.  I've got a ton of hair and those wimpy hotel Sunbeam wall mount dryers just don't cut it.<br /><br />Cons: It's expensive. I would not invest in this as your every day dryer as you can get a better full-size dryer for the price but if you travel a lot, as I do, the voltage option is key. It's a lot heavier and bulkier than the typical travel hair dryer so I would not recommend this if you're looking for something small. There is a hinge at the handle that allows it to fold but it's still far from compact.<br /><br />I've been taking this dryer with me to Europe and it works great. I've been using it intermittently for a year and it's still going strong. Essentially, it's a full-size dryer but with a voltage option.

"I've been using the same blow dryer since high school, and recently it caught fire, so that was that. I spent a long time reading reviews and comparing prices trying to find a new blow dryer and I eventually decided on this one after I was able to go to Target and see it outside of the box in person. This dryer is really awesome, it drys my hair fast, doesn't seem to cause too much damage to my hair and I love the rubberized feel of it while holding it. It doesn't have a lot fancy options or anything, just your generic three heat levels, three blow settings, and a cool button. However, my friend is a hair stylist at a pretty fancy hair salon and when she stayed over one night and used it after showering the next morning, she came out of the bathroom to ask about the blow dryer. She asked how much I paid for it, and after telling her, she indicated that she couldn't believe how well it worked. She also complained that she had recently had to buy a new blow dryer for work and she couldn't see much of a difference between hers and mine expect about $100."	4/13/2013

My hairdryer gave out recently so I was on the hunt for a new one. I purchased one in the store for double this price and I was not satisfied with it. It left my hair frizzy. One of my favorite things about this hairdryer is the slanted handle. It fits perfectly in my hand and it's just the right angle to dry my hair without twisting my hand. Another great thing about this hair is that it really does dry your faster. I am really amazed by how fast it dries your hair and does not leave you with a frizzy head. I can actually use the high speed and not make a mess of my hair. I love the 3 temperatures. Most hairdryers offer heat with the option of the cold button that you have to hold down. This hairdryer not only has the cold press button, but also high heat, low heat, and cool. So you don't have to hold down the cold button because the cool button is cold enough. I like to start out on high heat all over then I divide my hair and use low heat. After drying is complete, I like to set my hair with the cool option. The concentrator nozzle is just the right size. You can also remove the screen on the back of the hairdryer for easy cleaning. This is an amazing hairdryer. I love that I got the opportunity to test this hairdryer in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I would definitely recommend this hairdryer!"	2/16/2015

"If you already own a hair dryer, then you're probably okay.  Unless it's an older model on the fritz.  But if you are in the market for a new dryer, then this might be the dryer for you.<br /><br />Granted you aren't going to be using the 200% power all the time (I exaggerate...I'm funny...), but when you need it, it's nice to know it's there for a quick dry.  But quick drying tends to make big bushy hair, so be careful.  Most of the time I have it on the lower or standard setting.  It works great.<br /><br />It's light, well balanced, and a pretty color!  I use it mainly for drying my dog's hair (since I have none!), but my gal uses it regularly and really likes it.<br /><br />Again buy if you need a new hair dryer, otherwise you're probably okay.  It's like trading in your car.  The Camry is running fine, so do you need the Lexus?  If the Camry is going kaput then yeah.  So the same with the hair dryer.  See? Informative and funny!  You can chuckle now.  Really.  Go ahead."	12/14/2011

I have no idea.  I would think a man's hair dryer would have 2 settings: Off and On.  This one has a combination of settings and I have no idea what their purposes are.  It will blow air of varying heats at varying speeds, if that appeals to you.  I tend to just use hot and high.  I'm not real sure about the ions but it all sounds very scientific so I just leave that on.<br /><br />At any rate, I've had it for a couple of months now and have had no problems with it.  It really does blast the heat, and air too, so drying is pretty quick.  The little detachable nozzle is nice too, as leaving it on focuses the air better, but I took it off once when I need to work some duckback oilskin treatment into my oilskin coat (no, really).  This calls for a more even application of heat so the ability to remove the nozzle was actually handy.<br /><br />Overall I can't imagine how it could be better.<br /><br />I suppose it could dispense donuts but I can't really dock them a star for that oversight, I guess."	1/15/2013

It gets the job done.	"It's a hair dryer. I don't think it's horrible, but it's not spectacular, not like some of the other Xtava products I have used in the past. It doesn't look it, but it is lightweight and it's a really nice color blue. It comes with two attachments; a big customized diffuser and a concentrated nozzle for targeting styling. The diffuser was a little difficult to get on. It didn't fit as good as the concentrated nozzle. I also liked that it has a long cord which made it easier for me to move around when needed. This Rimini hair dryer comes with three heat levels, two power levels and a cool shot button to set your style. The different settings and attachments did make it easier when styling my hair. I could set them to what ever I needed them to be, when I needed them. I've never uses such a big diffuser like this before. It did dry my hair quickly, but I have very fine hair, so I don't need a lot of heat. It did help with the frizz and left my hair feeling smooth. I felt that it could have had a bit more power to it, but it was okay. For people with thicker hair, it might take a little longer to dry. Overall, this hair dryer was not bad, it does what a hair dryer is suppose to do and gets the job done. It's very easy to use and with all the different settings and attachments, it's convenient too.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

"This is my second T3 Featherweight hair dryer in 3 1/2 years, as the second one is a replacement for the first featherweight that stopped working.  I have always bought the cheap hair dryers at my local chain stores.  I had no idea what a difference a high quality hair dryer would make on my hair.  I have long hair (about to the middle my shoulder blades) and whenever I have to dry it I have to follow up with a straightening iron.  I am pleased to report that with the T3 Featherweight I no longer have to use my straightening iron.  My hair is straight, silky, and smooth to the touch...I was actually shocked the first time I dried my hair.  Not only did it look great but it took less time than normal (about 5 minutes less).  I do love that this hair dryer is so lightweight and quite.    My one and only complaint is that the T3 Featherweight hair dryer works for about 1 1/2 years before it shorts out.  It has happened twice with two different featherweight dryers.  With the featherweight costing me $200 you would think that it would last longer! Unfortunately my replacement T3 Featherweight hair dryer died yesterday (and it's no longer under warranty), so I bought a different professional brand hoping it will last longer. Sorry T3, I had to move on!!!    ALSO TO NOTE...when I received my first T3 Featherweight hair dryer in 2006 & the replacement one in 2008, the company (Bespoke Labs) had a 4 year warranty on their featherweight hair dryers.  Now I have noticed that Bespoke Labs has changed the warranty on this hair dryer to only 2 years!!!  Interesting!"	4/3/2010

"I have owned this type of hair dryer for about 8 years.  However, this particular hair dryer I just bought in September 2013 to replace the previous hair dryer that was the same as this, but it was a different color.  It has worked perfectly well until the other day.<br /><br />I don't know if anyone else has ever had this experience ever!  I have sometimes left my dryer plugged into my outlet after blow drying my hair and this time was no different.  But after my last usage on Tuesday I became sick and paid no attention to the dryer laying on the counter in my bathroom.  But I kept smelling a sweet smell coming from the bathroom area and just thought it was my plug in freshener.  I had just bought a new insert.  But the next day I saw a puddle of red underneath my dryer and I saw that the area next to the plug reel up was melting!!  Really, does something like that happen.  I pulled the dryer plug immediately and put the dryer on a paper towel and it continued to seem to melt.  Red kept flowing from it for quite awhile.  This could have been a fire issue and something inside the dryer overheated.  I don't know.  But I do know I feel uncomfortable using it and threw it away and will have to purchase a new one.  To Conair ... shame on you for manufacturing such a shoddy piece of equipment!  If anyone be able to illuminate me on what happened or has experienced the same thing, please reply and let me know.  Oh and I gave this dryer 3 stars because it worked perfectly up until the melting.  In fact I'm upset that I won't get to continue using it, but I won't take the chance now."	6/19/2014

It feels like a professional hair dryer and is not easy to break.<br /><br />Design: The cord on the dryer is somewhat rigid and unwieldy. It became easier to wrangle when I bought Velcro ties for the cord (On Amazon: VELCRO Brand - ONE-WRAP Thin Self-Gripping Cable Ties: Reusable, Light Duty - 8&#34; x 1/2&#34; Ties, 100 Pack - Black)<br /><br />Speed of drying: I can't say much here.

I also noticed a smell coming from the dryer. Reading through past reviews, I'm just glad my hair dryer didn't throw off sparks or catch on fire.

When I was given the opportunity to test this Ionic Hair dryer for quality, I was super excited.  There were many things I liked about this blow dryer.<br /><br />1.  I like the shape of the unit.  I was able to hold the dryer by both the shaft and the handle depending on my needs to get the best angle for all my hair.<br /><br />2.  It took about 1/3 less time to dry my hair than with my other blow dryer even though that one has more watts.  I'm not sure if it was due to the less drying time of the fact that this is an ionic dryer that my hair was less frizzy.  It's winter here in Indiana and I generally have to use argon oil on my hair after drying to tame the frizzies.  I did not have to use the oil after using this blow dryer.<br /><br />3.  It's extremely light weight and quieter than my previous dryer.<br /><br />4.  It came with both a diffuser and a concentration nozzle.  I use the diffuser when I want curly hair and the nozzle when I want to go straight and sleek.<br /><br />One thing I did notice is a burning smell the first time I used the unit.  By the time I finished drying my hair though, the smell was gone.  Overall, I am very impressed with the quality and results of this Rimini Xtava."	2/24/2015

"So I hadn't updated my hair dryer in years (think 15), so I was really thrilled to receive this one. I would highly recommend it!!!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Doesn't die on me when I am using it (overheating). This is a big one for me. I have very long hair and it seems every blower would take a water break halfway through because it was being worked too much. Not this one!<br /><br />Nice, modern look. LOVE the spunky metallic green color, not gaudy at all!<br /><br />Small, lightweight size.  MUCH smaller than the older one I had, and not nearly as heavy. Your hand won't fall off after using it! :)<br /><br />Usable Attachment.  I wasn't aware when I bought this, but it has an attachment on the end to focus the heat for styling. Since I have hair that curves in and frames the face, this is PERFECT for getting that look!  I only have to go over it once in order for it to be perfect.<br /><br />Hot and Cold.  The cold is actually NOT hot. Yes, it's not hot! Amazing! LOL  And the hot doesn't burn your eyelashes off!  Perfect in either setting, even the cooler version actually still dries your hair well!<br /><br />Negatives: None that I can think of!<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend it!

I love the built in cord retractor, especially for traveling, which we do often. I have so many gadgets I need to bring, my suitcase is always a mess of cords. In addition to that, it dries my hair SO fast. I have fairly thick hair, though it's thinned over the years a bit, and it would take me in upwards of 20 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer. Using this dryer with a ceramic brush has my hair dry in under 10 minutes every time. The cool shot option is great for just adding a bit of curl around a brush if you're in a hurry, too! My hair tends to get a bit curly as it dries, so I really like the diffuser attachment as well. It works perfectly to smooth out my hair without it poofing out like crazy. I still like to follow up with my straightener because it makes my hair really shine and glow, but the diffuser makes the job much easier. I've been using tourmaline ceramic dryers for years and I have MUCH less breakage and a huge reduction in split ends since making the switch, so at this price, this dryer/styler is a must have!"	2/2/2015

I'm really fussy about the air flow, most dryers don't seem to push enough air through to satisfy me, but this one is perfect. It drys quickly, and the heat settings are perfect. The only problem I've faced is about 6 months ago the product starts to make high pitched screaming/squealing noises, and they are LOUD. I like to dry my hair upside down, and I can't anymore because the dryer is especially noisy (I believe the fan unit has come lose and shakes around in the barrel which leads to the screeching). Besides that, it's lasted a long time, and it's a great product at a price you can't beat. After 4 years my current one is probably unsafe to use, so I am ordering my second one soon."	9/8/2013

It had a built in GFCI feature and the trip switch eventually became stuck so that it would not turn on. I replaced the plug with a new, heavy duty one I bought at Home Depot, figuring the bathroom outlet's GFCI feature would provide the same protection. Then last night, while drying my daughter's hair, it started to smell of something burning and a few hot ceramic embers came shooting out. One stung my daughter on the back of the neck and while I waved my hand in front I got one embedded in my hand. Very small but very hot stinging. I threw it away for safety reason. So, it worked fine for 3 years but died an painful death. Be aware.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I was using a 25 year old, 1200 watt hair dryer. It may lost some of its punch over the years but it did dry hair. This is an upgrade, but it isn't a radical difference. The upside is the retractable cord. This makes getting it out and putting it away much easier and faster. The downside is that the cord is fairly short (the big safety device at the plug end is another story). I'll learn to live with it, but when I'm trying to dry the hair of my 7 and 8 year olds, who move around a lot, a longer cord is welcome. Now I have to get them to move their head around instead of me moving the dryer around. One thing I have noticed is that my kids now complain the air is too hot, something they didn't do with the old dryer (I have to switch to medium heat, and then it takes longer). It has a hot, medium and cool setting (and a cool push button for interrupting a hot flow) and slow and fast speeds. The buttons for speed and temperature are similar and you need to remember which is which. The cord retraction button, which is not obvious, is up on the motor housing; somehow I keep forgetting it's there. Overall, a good dryer, with some benefits and drawbacks."	9/17/2009

I was willing to pay more money if the product was worth it.  I read several reviews here of people saying they have tried the T3 and that this dryer is better, so I bought this one for $32.  After using it once I am SO happy with it.  It dried my hair in about 7 minutes, which is about half the time of my old dryer (which wasn't even a bad dryer to begin with).  My hair came out looking so much smoother and more tame, and as a result I spent less time with the flat iron.  I have the companion Remington T-studio 2-1/4 Flat Iron [[ASIN:B001LF4G4Y Remington S-9400 Tstudio Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline 2 1/4 Wide Plates]], and LOVE it just as much.

I have been doing this for about 10 years. I love the twin turbo brand. I had to send out my 3200 (which i love) for service.  I ordered this one overnight to get me by for a few weeks. I HATE IT. Its not the blowdryer itself but the way the nozzle attaches to it.  It pulls hair like crazy. Everyone in the salon that borrows my dryer hates it too. Im glad my 3200 will be back soon and I will only have to use this as a back up or when I need my assistant to help with an additional blowdryer. Get a 3200 or a 3800 as they do not have this design flaw.	5/25/2013

So I have requested another return and pickup and asked them not to resend another one.  My hair is naturally curly and I need the diffuzer.  Yes I can buy a diffuzer anywheres, but since I paid for it with this one, I shouldn't have to go buy one. Not sure what they call a diffuzer, but the round flat attachment is not a diffuzer.

It would've been better as a grey color.  I'll probably air dry my hair mostly and finish up the rest of the moisture with this.  The worst part about this dryer really is the switch.

I have one other minor objection. I mounted mine in the leg well under the dressing area on the left side. There one can see the led light leaking out the bottom of the cabinet and not just through the bezel that it is supposed to. the light leak is something I could fix with RTV silicon, I just haven't bothered. A better design would include a case that fits better to it's base and doesn't leak light, and would also only have the light on when it's dark instead of all the time. Again, it's not quiet. We bought it for our guest bath, so as much as our guests stay here they shouldn't go deaf. No way I'd put up with this noise if it was our primary. This unit doesn't deserve to call itself quiet, so if you need quiet keep shopping."	2/6/2013

She uses a hair drier frequently and have seen her with frizzy hair from it at times. I figured this would be a perfect test.<br /><br />The dryer has a balanced feel to it and isn't too heavy. The body is made of plastic that feels solid. If you squeeze it will creak and crack but it still feels solid. The intake and output screens are metal and should hold up well. It has a very nice cable stress relief on the dryer side that looks like it will help with and last through all the waving around that is sure to come. The plug side has a nice and compact GFI built into it so you are less likely to die from using it. Size wise I think this is a stay at home dryer. I would look for something a bit more compact for travel if you need one.<br /><br />The side of the handle contains two switches. One for temperature (cool, warm, and hot) one for speed (off, low, and high). There is a momentary switch on the handle in the trigger position for the cool shot function.<br /><br />After turning her loose with this for a few weeks my wife says her hair definitely is less frizzy and feels softer after using this dryer versus her other dryer. I can confirm this as well, it feels softer to me and I notice it is less frizzy.<br /><br />I'm sold on it after seeing what it does and as with anything your mileage may vary but it works well for my wife and she wouldn't hesitate to recommend this dryer to her friends."	9/13/2011

"The controls are pretty straight forward, no different than most other hairdryers.  Has off, high, and low switch along with a cool shot that surpresses the heat for cool drying.  Works really well and heats nicely. I have short hair so it only took a minute to dry.  I had other family members with long hair give it a shot and all agreed it was top notch.    Really like the metallic apple color too, makes a boring hairdryer look like a pretty cool appliance.    The negative has to do with the weight. This is not what I would consider a travel hairdryer. One other reviewer mentions it weighs over 2 lbs and they thought that was light... I totally disagree. If you travel a lot you know that 2 lbs added to your suitcase can make a big difference. Even lugging this thing to the gym everyday would be a work out. It does come with a travel pouch and a nice feature of easily twisting and untwisting the handle does make it a little more compact, but it is still rather bulky to stick in a gym bag or carry on suitcase.    I highly recommend this unit for home use, for travel, I'd suggest you find a more compact/lightweight unit and skip this one."	4/1/2011

The con for me (someone that has long, thin, fine hair) is that it tends to be hot even on the lower settings. Sometimes this is a pro but overall for my hair type it is a bit too hot for the total drying process so my hair tends to be more tangled at the end.

The AC2015C has two switches, one allows you to select between three temperatures, the other between two speeds. There is a &#34;cool shot&#34; button. I have fine, straight shoulder length hair and don't really use my dryer for anything other than drying, so I've never understood the purpose of a cool shot button. Were I to use this function, I prefer my existing drying because you can set it to cool mode with the switch, while the new model requires you to hold the button down continuously for cool air. The AC2015C is more than twice as heavy as and slightly larger than my existing dryer, which I didn't care for. Pros of the AC2015C are that it is a nice looking dryer, and if its anything like my old Remington, it will probably last forever.

In the morning, I don't want to spend 20 minutes just making sure my hair is dry before I leave. I want some time to style, too.<br /><br />This hair dryer has a professional quality motor (1875 watt AC motor) which translates to stronger air flow, hotter air, and less drying time. That's exactly what I wanted and that's what I got. This hairdryer, with the airflow concentrator attachment, dried my hair in under 7 minutes, which is unheard of for me. It has 3 heat settings, 2 fan speeds, and a cool air shot button.<br /><br />BONUS: This hair dryer is quieter than a lot of others I've owned. It's still a hair dryer, so it'll make noise, but this one's noises are hushed.<br /><br />Besides its speedy drying, it's just a really pretty hair dryer. It's got an attractive black matte finish that's soft to the touch. It also features pretty pink pearlescent buttons and accents.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: I recommend this hair dryer to those who are looking for a quiet, yet powerful hair dryer to streamline their morning routine."	2/14/2014

"I have three teenage daughters so recently I purchased three different hair dryers from Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I realized two were essentially identical except for the price, the length of the cord and the brand name. The Pro Beauty Tools 5885 Professional Lightweight Hair Dryer is the exact same as the Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black by Revlon. Both of these hair dryers are made by Helen of Troy. Both have the same handle, body, and heat/speed options.  Both have the exact same Intertek number (3175842). The major difference is the Pro Beauty Tools hair dryer does have a cord that is 2' longer than the Revlon dryer and it (the Pro Beauty Tools) has an extra filter included. For the $10 difference in price (Pro Beauty Tools higher) one can decide if these options are worth the extra cash. In my opinion both of these items are a FIVE STAR item for price and performance."	4/6/2013

I previously had a ConAir and in comparison I think this one is of higher quality.  It is heavier than my previous one, but I think this is due to the quality of the motor which I am hoping does in fact help this hair dryer to last longer than most.  It does feel slightly awkward due to the weight and length of the barrel, but nothing that I found as a hindrance.  I noticed that several other reviewers had trouble with getting their hair stuck in the rear vent, I have long hair and have yet to have this problem, but I do agree that a cap of some sort would be nice to prevent this.<br /><br />The hair dryer includes three different heat settings- I found one to be quite hot, one warm, and one cool.  It also included two speeds.  I have found that the fastest speed is best used with attachments otherwise my long hair would get quite tangled.  As far as time, it seems slightly faster, though not as noticeable as I thought it might.<br /><br />My hair does feel quite smooth and seems to be less heat damaged from my drying, though I think time will tell if this hair dryer is truly salon quality."	11/11/2013

"My hair is super thick and in the past when I used to blow dry it never came out soft and smooth like after the salon, it was always dry and frizzy. A beautician friend of mine recommended switching to a ceramic iononic conditioning hair dryer and recommended the brand Hot Tools. I had purchased a ridiculously over priced hot tools hair dryer and I figured you have to pay more for results. I no longer had dry frizzy hair after blow drying, it was silky, soft and smooth just like after the salon and I was overjoyed. Several weeks ago my hot tools hair drier broke. I couldn't afford to replace it so I looked for a cheaper alternative. I found this dryer for more than 50 dollars cheaper than the one I was trying to replace and it had very similar specifications, so I took a chance and I've never been happier. It does such a better job than the over priced professional hair dryer. My hair dries in nearly half the time. It's never been smoother or softer.<br /><br />The drier is much lighter than my old one and comfortably fits in my hand due to its ergonomic shape. It isn't very loud like most driers, instead of a high pitched whiny sound it's nice low whooshy sound. I always compared hair driers to sounding like a power drill... well this one doesn't sound like a power drill, it sounds like a device that blows air, like it should. The included attachments (concentrator and diffuser) are an added bonus. I've used the concentrator with great success and I haven't used the diffuser yet (since I recently cut my hair very short and only use a diffuser for my natural waves when my hair is long).<br /><br />For the price the blow dryer definitely exceeds expectations. I'm going to buy the other remington Tstudio styling tools just based on my experience with the dryer."	6/7/2013

The Remington works great.  Everything works as it should and it puts out a bunch of air and cools down quickly when you are through using it.  Easy to regulate the temperature and the unit has great fit and finish.  The one item worth noting is that the Remington is about a quarter pound heavier than the BaByliss which may be an issue if you use it for long periods of time.  I highly recommend this hair dryer.	3/15/2015

"When my old Remington dryer that is 7 years old broke I started looking for a replacement, needless to say I ended up returning 4 dryers before I found this one. I loved my old dryer because it was so quiet, I can't stand the dryers that have a high pitched whining noise. So I called Remington & they told me this was the quietest dryer they make (they measure by decibels & this dryer had the lowest). So I bought it & it is super quiet, the motor doesn't really give off any noise the only sound you hear is the airflow. And the airflow on this dryer is super strong, its much stronger than my last dryer so it does dry your hair pretty quick. I am very pleased with this product. It comes with a 4 year warranty too. The hot setting is hot but its nice because it doesn't get hot enough wear it feels like its burning your scalp. I actually bought mine at walmart online for $27, it was such a great deal! I highly recommend this dryer, its great."	5/11/2010

The diffuser does a decent job of diffusing the air and dried my hair well without firzzing it.

It does, however, have a burst-of-cold-air button which is difficult to use.  It's positioned in such a way that you feel it should be pushed UP instead of IN. This button is rectangular and flat, again making it look and feel like it should be pushed up and not in.  Trying to push this button IN is often somewhat difficult (too thin; too highly set) and takes several tries.  If it weren't for that button, which I seem to use a lot, I'd have given it 5 stars instead of 4.  Other than that, I do like this hairdryer."	1/31/2015

"First, let me start by saying, I use my blow dryer lightly compared to others, so I can't comment on the longevity of this dryer. I am convinced there is no perfect hair dryer out there, but this particular one does a great job.<br /><br />I really like how quiet this is compared to some other models I've owned. Even on high, the noise is dramatically muted (if you shower during your childs naptime as I do, then this is HUGE!). While I initially thought the retractable cord would be a plus, it makes storing the entire unit very cumbersome. I keep my dryer in a drawer in my bathroom. My old dryer had to have the cord wrapped around it a million times, but overall, it was pretty compact. Not so with this model. The end of the plug cord is thicker, and difficult to bend, and the nose of the dryer is a bit longer then I'm used to. Not the end of the world though.<br /><br />I tried the diffuser one day, but found it to be a huge pain to work with, so I just set it aside...I've gone this long without ever using one, I'm sure I'll be fine without it. I always keep the concentrator on though (which only adds to the size of the dryer come storage time). It's great for quick, high temp drying, or for bangs. Overall, I'd recommend this. It's a good dryer that gets the job done, even though storing it can be kinda awkward.."	9/7/2009

Lately, it has started to get hot while using it and if I turn it off it won't turn back on until it cools down.  My husband says it's because it has a lot of dust in it.  He could take it apart and clean it out and it would probably last for several more years, but I miss the retractable cord.

I've looked at this one online a few times but couldn't justify the price.  Then it  went on sale and I jumped on it.  Just got it, first use.  It's not silver, like the one pictured, but I didn't buy it for color so I don't care (mine is kind of a gunmetal black).  Beautifully packaged, easy to understand directions/ switches (and they should be- I'm drying my hair, not launching a rocket into space).  A bit heavier than my last dryer, but not uncomfortable.  I did notice a really mild chemical odor, but I was using the dryer on its highest setting and I'm guessing it had to do with the casing heating up.  The odor did go away and it was never overpowering and didn't make me think the dryer was going to explode in my hand or anything.  The dryer did NOT dry my thick, mid-back length hair in 5 minutes (as was claimed by another reviewer, I think) but it did SIGNIFICANTLY decrease my drying time.  Took about 22 minutes down from 40-50 (and would still have damp spots), and that was with a little extra time fiddling around styling because.....MY HAIR LOOKS AWESOME.  Seriously.  I could be in a hair products commercial right now, I'm not kidding.  I feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste just sitting inside writing an Amazon review, but this baby deserves it so I sat right down to do it.  I would have NEVER believed a dryer would make so much difference (otherwise I'd have bought this ages ago), but truly, I look like I just walked out of the salon.  I want to stockpile these so I never have to live without it.  This was a phenomenal deal on sale, but I would pay full price (and then some) knowing what I know now."	8/15/2015

I have very frizzy hair, and this is the first blow dryer I have owned that actually helps to reduce frizz. My hair is almost frizz free after I blow dry, so I can just quickly run my flat iron over it rather than having to iron tiny sections to remove the frizz. The high speed is very powerful, and it dries my hair quickly. The retractable cord is a great feature so the cord isn't laying all over my counter when I'm not using the dryer. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 (I would have liked to give it 4.75 if I could) is because it takes a little while to heat up.

I felt confident when ordering the brand name because I figured they had years of experience with these products. I purchased this item new in the box and I have had wall mount dryers before and are an easy install.  Conair's metal wall mount holes in the plate were too small for the screws given. There was no way to screw them into the plate to attach to the wall.  I had to search my garage for self tapping metal screws to match the hole size and finally after a good hour or so was able to attach the wall plate that holds the dryer. Once I unpacked the dryer and hung it on the wall plate, I noticed the dust cover on the back of the dryer looked loose. After inspecting the problem, I found that one of the prongs that hold it to the dryer was missing. To add to all the existing problems the grip that hold the hair dryer handle was so loos that it hardly held the hair dryer in place when it is sitting back in the cradle.<br />I called Conair customer service to see what they could do for me and I was told they have no parts for this hair dryer. I would need to contact Amazon to return or replace.  What a complete waste of time not to mention I threw my old hair dryer out. I will not be purchasing another Conair wall mount dryer in the future."	6/30/2014

It feels substantial in my hands, not flimsy and cheap. It comes with 2 diffuser type attachments that connects easily and stay in place until you take them off.<br /><br />The cord on this hairdryer is super long so I can move around quite a bit while drying my hair. There is also a loop built in the handle so this hair dryer can be hung up for storage purposes.<br /><br />The hairdryer itself has a cool shot button which you hold down if you want cool air to blow out. There is another button that changes the forcefulness of the air that is blowing out (this one has 2 settings). The last button is high, medium and low for the warmth of the heat that will blow out of the hair dryer.<br /><br />This hair dryer is 1875 watts so it is pretty powerful and it dries my hair pretty quickly.

"I've owned and used this dryer daily for the last 12 years. Works well on my wavy average thick hair. Its sturdy and dang near indestructible because its been dropped plenty of times.

Only complaint is that the filter can not be completely removed to clean it out (has a cover but it doesn't really do much, lots of lint still gets in there). We have to use a q-tip and canned air spray to try and remove the lint. I am going to upgrade and see what that gets me.

This is very hard to handle, hard to use to style your hair (well, my hair) and worse, the motor sounds sick.  It makes a kind of lame vroom-vroom sound like it can't quite decide it wants to be running.

So, I don't have time to go to the salon and sit there for hours until my hair gets blown out.<br /><br />Thankfully, with my hair, all I have to do are rollers and sit under the dryer for 40 minutes and boom...no salon, nice waves, better than blown out! Much cheaper than going to the salon, btw.<br /><br />I looove that the dryer has a timer, which means I don't have to watch the clock constantly. The dryer gets VERY hot, almost too hot (I used the highest setting), but that means I spent less time under the dryer. It's not very loud at all, which I also like. Also, in order to adjust height in most dryers, one needs to turn some sort of knob, right? Not with this one! I just push it down as low as I need or pull it up as high as I need, and I'm done. Some people may not be used to his, but it works for me.<br /><br />When I do rollers, I only use the Jumbo/Extra Large ones all around my head. Even so, I'm STILL able to fit under and inside  the bonnet.<br /><br />I took off one star b/c it was a bit challenging putting it together. The materials seem a bit cheap, but overall, the dryer gets very hot, is not noisy, and makes it look like I went to the salon!<br /><br />Good buy, great value."	6/5/2013

I have very thick hair and it would take me up to 2 hours or more sitting in one position while being very conscious to not slouch. The Conair SB1 Bonnet Hair Dryer allows me to be more flexible with where I can dry my hair. Before I would have to be seated near a table only. Now I can sit on the couch or even lay on the bed. I have put this on and taken a nap while it dried my hair. It can be a bit uncomfortable since the hose gets hot after sometime and will touch your skin, so it does require some adjustment there. The benefits though were worth it to me. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has long hair drying times and would like to be able to sit at their PC or watch TV or just have their hair dry while they take a nap or go to bed at night."	6/15/2011

I watched the utube video of the woman with naturally curly hair and how she used this particular dryer because I have permed hair and need a diffuser and medium air pressure to dry my hair but still keep the curls. My previous Sassoon hair dryer did a great job of drying as well as maintaining my slowly diminishing &#34;old perm&#34; curls but with a little scrunching with mousse and my old, non ion ceramic dryer, my curls still looked good.<br /><br />With my purchase of the Remington AC2015  &#34;pearl, ionic&#34; dryer additions, I looked forward to the same old but better.....My hair is much more shiny and less frizzy, yes, but I do have to work with scrunching/spray to get those curls that I had when drying with my old non-pearl ceramic, etc. hairdryer. I think the ceramic or pearl or ionic features of this dryer are wonderful but, for someone like me with a loose perm of about 10 months, the dryer makes my hair just &#34;too smooth&#34;.<br /><br />Am certain this model would be perfect for all those ladies with gorgeous, thick hair who want the smooth look at a very very good price.<br /><br />Diffuser is included which did entice me to purchase this hair dryer as I do need to use a diffuser. BTW, reviewers have said dryer could be lighter in weight but it's perfectly OK with me. I felt my old dryer was OK regarding weight and feel this one is, as well. Not noisy at all, despite what some have said. I use it on medium airflow and medium heat and I'm very happy - not loud and I could definitely use the dryer for as long as it took to dry my hair if I had long hair w/o freaking out because of its noise."	12/1/2014

As other reviewers have stated the area of cord where it comes out of the handle wears out and short circuits causing pops, sparks and fire! This happened after 1 year of use almost to the day. I live alone and use it once/day mostly on high heat. The problem is obviously a cheap cord that when bent back and forth enough times will wear the wire enough to short out. This is not a fluke but  bad design components. When I compare the cord to other dryers I clearly see the difference in cord. This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel. Believe me this will happen to all of these units eventually if you use the high heat settings daily. I would definitely not buy this again.<br /><br />and<br /><br /> I would look for another brand."	7/12/2015

Cons: The controls are very difficult for me to work with the machine running - the placement is maybe made for a bigger hand, but I can't reach the cool button comfortably when I'm using my right hand. The diffusor is very hard to attach, and even harder to detach.  And this one is my fault - I just assumed that all dryers came with a concentrator, but this one doesn't. I tried attaching the concentrator  from my Revlon dryer that just stopped working, and it doesn't fit. (Shouldn't they be universal?) Unfortunately I threw out all the packaging after I checked to make sure it worked upon delivery. Otherwise I would return it."	2/15/2015

It's powerful but not super loud (for a hair dryer, at least), I can get my long hair dry and straight in about 8-10 minutes on warm temperature + medium strength (I'd rather take a couple extra minutes than do extra damage to my hair), and the settings are user-friendly. Before I bought it, I didn't care so much about the retractable cord but now that I've had it for a while, I don't think I could ever go back! It's an incredibly convenient feature, especially living in a tiny NYC apartment. I highly recommend this product."	1/29/2011

"I've used Conair dryers for years, but they share the same issue with other brands......the little mesh screen filter in the back gets easily clogged with dust, lint, and hair....causing the unit to overheat and eventually die.  I've tried everything to keep that little screen clean, including carefully brushing it with a small stiff brush....but then the particulates fall into the motor causing more problems or the lint and stuff just plain won't come off the filter.<br /><br />I just received this new dryer, to replace a Conair model from several years ago.  Conair FINALLY hired someone with some common sense!  I was surprised.....this unit has a REMOVABLE screen filter!  Which means I can take it off and WASH it (being very careful to insure it's totally dry before replacing on the unit, of course), extending the life of my unit.<br /><br />Big selling point in my opinion....removable filter info should be in the description.  Bravo, Conair, well done!"	12/27/2013

This hair dryer is by far the best one that I have ever owned! The price was definitely right! I love how quiet it is compared to other hair dryers that I have owned! It has three heat settings and three speed settings along with the cool button that you can press to get a blast of cool air. It dries my hair a lot faster than other hair dryers and it leaves my hair feeling softer than when I dry it with other hair dryers. I would definitely recommend this to others!	7/16/2015

"My wife (who doesn't speak / write English by the way, hense not writing this herself) especially likes the attachments and overall quality of this dryer, the three heat settings which provide just the right range, as well as the no heat / blow only setting.<br /><br />But she says the blower is far too strong and wonders why it doesn't provide a lower setting than hurricane strength.  I can only guess that this is because if the heat setting is on high there has to be a minimum amount of fan strength to keep the unit from catching fire.<br /><br />I imagine that a professional hair stylist has the advantage of being able to hold the dryer some distance away from a customer's head and that's why it's so hot and blows so strong, but of course someone using it on themselves doesn't have that advantage.<br /><br />Ceramic is nice, as well as the ion emissions.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Despite complaining about the strength of the fan, she already tossed her old dryer and uses this one because it is a professional level item.  I imagine she'll get used to the fan strength."	5/14/2009

This hair dryer has, without exception, left my hair extremely unruly.  It makes my hair appear very dry and unhealthy.  I have used some excellent ionic hair dryers in the past and kept waiting for this one to work as well.  Big mistake.  The high heat is extremely hot and damaging to hair.  The medium heat just doesn't seem to create any smoothness and there is no cooling button.  One must keep switching the heat settings constantly while trying to dry your hair.

"I love this Allure professional Ionic ceramic hair dryer by Xtava!!! When I received this hair dryer in the mail I was so excited to test it out as my old hair dryer just crapped out the other day and I've been without a hair dryer. I'm in love with the design & quality of this hair dryer I love the sleek black design!!! This hair dryer is also made of high quality materials which is a plus for me as It needs to be able to last a long time. Its pretty light it weight compared to my old dryer with I love so it won't made my wrist tired since I have long hair that normally takes a long time to dry I need to be able to have a dryer that light enough to hold for a long time. This dryer includes a Concentrator Nozzle with I love and works amazingly!! This attachment is said to direct maximized condensed air flow to the area you are targeting, adding precision and focus while controlling frizz and style outcome which it definitely does!! It also seems to dry my hair a lot faster then my old dry with saves me time!!  It also has a 2 speed settings and 3 heat setting which  work wonders and are a great feature to have!!  I am really impressed with this dryer & I definitely would recommend this Hair Dryer by Xtava & brand to everyone !! I was so excited to receive this hair dryer from the company to test and share my opinion!!"	2/13/2015

My soap now stays dry and firm, and my bath mat doesn't get waterlogged.<br />Best feature - The magnet which holds the dryer in the cradle. Most plastic latches fail after a few months, but the magnet should be bulletproof. I also like the long cord which reaches to the end of my 5 foot shower.

Anyways… This dryer didnt even work!! I opened the package and all the parts were there.

There was no air flow, no power light- NOTHING!!!<br /><br />I will be returning this, but I am yet to hear from the seller (this just happened today). I will come back on here to write an update and let you ladies know how/if they resolve the issue. I expect I will have to pay return shipping- but thats not fair given that I was shipped a defective item! (If I do- I will leave negative feedback).<br /><br />Overall the appearance of this dryer was &#34;cheap&#34;. The stickers surrounding the dials were peeling off once I opened the box, and the dryer hood wasn't very sturdy on the pole. Don't get me wrong- I wasn't expecting this to be a &#34;Mr. Pibbs&#34; by any means, but good grief- I at least expected it to turn on!! I must've gotten a bad dryer b/c the other reviews on here are decent (hence my deciding to purchase one). But ladies take my advice…. if you want a &#34;risk free&#34; piece of equipment then just save up and get a Mr. Pibbs.

It has a high and low setting, and gets the job done effectively because it has such a strong blow. The only problem I had with it, is that the back end of it kept sucking in my hair, and it resulted in it giving off the smell of burning hair, and accompanied by it no longer working as well as it could, after 3 weeks of having it. The only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a three is because you and me both have the responsibility of keeping our hair away from the back end of the hair dryer. The reason why it does not have a 5 is because, although it is very strong, could not handle a few pieces of hair getting into the fan part, which is understandable, but still an engineering flaw.

I hadn't purchased a hair dryer in over a decade and the price was a little hard to swallow.  After some reseach and all of the fantastic reviews I decided to go for it.  I am SO glad that I did!  This hair dryer doesn't get scorching hot but gets hot enough and has power like no other!  My hair feels softer after using it and I don't even need to use the straightener afterwards.  I personally don't have a problem with the weight of the hair dryer and it's no louder than any other hair dryer I've used.  If anything I think it's slightly quieter than most.  What used to take about 12 minutes to blow dry my hair now takes 5 minutes, literally 5 minutes or less from wet to dry  (the first time I used it I timed it at 4 minutes 20 seconds!).  It is absolutely incredible and saves me so much time!  Beyond happy I bought this and I would easily recommend to anyone."	4/14/2014

CONS:  It is the heaviest dryer I have ever owned, the buttons are so awkwardly placed that it is difficult to get a good grip w/out changing a setting, & it takes a long time to dry my hair (much longer than my last few dryers).<br /><br />Why did so many people rave about this?

To try to avoid that makes you hold the dryer in a very awkward manner. You would think they would notice when testing.  It is also heavy and bulky. I did not notice any additional shine to my hair.  The low setting is really cool and the hot is not very hot.  Takes a lot longer to dry my very short hair.  The only thing I did like was the hanging hoop. If I hadn't purchased it a long time ago as a back-up dryer I would return it.	8/8/2012

You just have to know how to use these types of dryers	"I bought this a few months ago and decided to go ahead and just now review it after months of using it.  I love it.  I had one of these growing up and I didn't know they still made hair dryers like these.  It does take a tad bit longer to dry your hair, but if you are wanting to straighten your hair you know it takes time to get that look.  It fits well in my hand.  It's not too heavy.  I don't use the comb attachments.  A lot of people complain about the brush attachment, but I guess they never used one growing up and know the trick with the brush.  No it doesn't grab onto your hair like a regular brush does since it's so soft AND because the air is blowing your hair away from the brush itself.  I put my hand on the other side of my hair.  So I have the hairdryer with the brush attached on one side. the hair in the middle (of course) and I have my hand on the other side to keep the hair pressed into the bristles."	11/6/2013

"I always thought a blow dryer was a blow dryer and they all did the same thing.  Boy was I wrong about this hair dryer.  It is not the same as all the others.  I have straight, thick hair and have a hard time getting volume due to the weight of my hair making it lay flat.  I do blow dry my hair to give it some volume but it usually doesn't last long.  But with the Panasonic hair dryer, I get so much volume! It is amazing!  I don't know if it is due to the moisture being put back into the hair but my hair looks great and others have told me the same thing.  My hair also seems to hold the volume almost all day long which is unusual for my hair.<br /><br />At first the dryer took a little bit of getting used to as it is a bit bulky, but it is light weight.  After a few days I got the hang of it and now I am getting the most out of the dryer.  Several heat setting make blow drying easy to get the results that you want.  Love it!"	11/23/2014

I did not purchase this on Amazon..I purchased from a local Sally's after my Gold N Hot (see my review) died a few weeks after purchase.  The attachment to this one seals really well and it dries like a pro!  True tourmaline technology..though most dryers say the hair will dry silky and without frizz..this one ACTUALLY does the trick.  Most other brands do not.  My hair was so straight I really could have just curled it instead of flat ironing.  Really Really nice dryer.  Great replacement for the junk I thought was a good product.	1/2/2013

It helps my wife dry her hair in a fair amount of time, less than her previous hair dryer. Seems to work pretty good. Typically loud when on, so I leave the room. Also, of note, this hair dryer does not have an actual turbo despite the product description. I feel like this is either false advertising and I have been duped, or the seller has no idea what the hell a turbo actually is. Turbos are found on internal combustion engines, both gasoline and diesel. If 'turbo' is meant to mean something like &#34;strong wind&#34;, they should have used a word like Kyōfū, which is Japanese for &#34;strong wind&#34;. Or maybe the German word for &#34;hair dryer&#34;, which is föhn. Either way, don't be fooled. There is no actual turbo, &#34;quiet fan and motor&#34; is subjective. It is loud. And I have not tested the &#34;lifeline shock protection&#34;. I would hope it works, but after the other misleading information, your results may vary."	4/14/2015

I have very long hair (below my waist) and it worked just fine for me.  The ion feature makes a huge difference in the condition of my hair.  Less frizz and less tangling.    The other day I was putting it away and noticed a crack in the cord's plastic insulation.  When I flexed the cord (after it was unplugged) at the crack the insulation completely separated exposing the wires.  Further inspection showed cracks in the insulation every where the cord had been bent when stored.  Normally we are very careful to stow appliance cords by folding (accordian style) and using velcro to hold in place.  For my new hair dryer I will be less fastidious with the cord storage!  You probably should inspect the cord before every use to make sure the insulation is not cracked.  It could have caused a fire, electric shock, or worse."	1/29/2009

"I've had two Revlon hairdryers over the past year and this one worked better than the subsequent one. I think I may have escaped burning my hair by taking the back filter off of it; my dryer also sparked but I realized it was because it was overheating. Taking the filter off the back creates better air intake and I guess fixed the problem (and I avoided, apparently, setting my hair on fire).<br /><br />Of course, you shouldn't have to do this, and doing so creates further problems. The filter is there to keep your hair from being sucked into the back of the hairdryer, so for the rest of its life I had to be insanely careful of how I held it. Unfortunately, even my drastic efforts didn't save it--it only lasted about six months. The transformer somehow stopped working.<br /><br />The worst part of my experience is that I bought another one, albeit a different model. I tend to blame technical difficulties on user error, but I can see in this case I was not alone. Don't buy this hairdryer; better yet, try another brand."	11/13/2012

I am an African American women with thick 4B/4C natural hair.  I bought this after reading some good reviews and I have to say it wasn't that great for me.  I thought it would be a bit more powerful blowing wise and it was just didn't have the blowing power I expected and didn't blow my hair out as straight as I am used to.  The heat settings were just ok also. I almost could not feel the difference in medium and high heat and to be honest I much rather prefer the dryers with separate heat and speed settings because you have more control over how much heat your using to dry your hair.  The comb attachments are cheaply made ans definitely seem like the break easily.  Overall its a decent blow dryer but not the best you can get for the price.  I'm actually returning mine to get something better.	6/27/2014

Conair dryer that she loved.  She figured sticking with Conair would be a safe bet, given how long her mini travel dryer had lasted.  WRONG.  She had this one less than a year before the plug box started repeatedly shorting out whenever it was plugged in.  (We've never had any problems with other appliances plugged into the same outlet, including other hairdryers).  Ultimately, the plug box started smoking from the repeated shorts whenever the prongs touched outlet.

My daughters and I have all tested it, and we've had consistently good results. We have long, medium, and short hairstyles between us. We all have straight, fine hair and a lot of it. Our hair tends to get flat, not frizzy.<br /><br />The dryer does work faster than other dryers we've had, and it is quieter. Blowouts result in shinier, smoother hair than before. I like the multiple settings, although there is a learning curve, and I found myself pushing the wrong switches at first. The cold shot of air is a real help in styling, especially for short hair styles. We've used the concentrator, and it fits securely and stays on.<br /><br />I thought the dryer was a bit heavy, but my kids (12 and 14) never mentioned the weight. It's been hard to get them to blow dry their hair, but they wanted to use this dryer -- a big plus to me, I admit. (I'd be a stylist if I wanted to give someone a blowout, but I'm not and I don't.) It's a full-sized blow dryer and comes with loop so you can hang it if you wish. I wasn't sure where I wanted to store the dryer, so I temporarily rested in inside the strong box it comes in and tucked the box in my linen closet between a stack of towels and the wall. It's worked so well that I'm still using it, but it's a nice looking dryer, and I would display it if my bathroom were larger and had more wall space."	10/28/2013

Since I didn't notice the cracks within the one month return policy, I cannot even return the product.

"I've owned a lot of hairdryers in my time (who hasn't?), and this is the first one I can ever recall wanting to review.  I had to buy a new dryer because I left my other one at mom's.  Knowing I'd be home to collect that one (which came from a beauty supply store and works well), I grabbed this one (cheaply) at Target. I think I more or less chose it because it was cute, but I've wound up loving it for more practical reasons.  I very much prefer it to the one it replaced.  One reason is tactile; it has a nice almost-soft finish that's comfortable to touch or hold.  Ergonomically, it simply feels right in my hand.  It's very well balanced.  The cool air option works great; far cooler air (esp for a sustained time) than any other dryer I've owned.  The air opening is a little bit smaller than average, so it provided well directed air.  (There is also a good diffuser included if you need to diffuse rather than direct.)  Provides a good and shiny and smooth blow out.  Quickly.  Even on cool air! The cord is NOT retractible, but is is a good length and doesn't seem to tangle easily.  I would recommend this product."	12/13/2010

"If you want to see these lipcolors in action, I suggest watching the first movie in the Twilight Saga. Bella Swan wore the color Good to Go, and the entire Cullen family (males and females) wore the shade Ms. Behavin'. Though I love these lipsticks, they are not for everyone. The colors are buildable (you can easily add more to any look), but they go on VERY sheer. They are meant more for enhancing natural lip color than for actually changing their color, and touch ups are necessary after just an hour or two. If you choose to purchase this product, I recommend buying a lip stick primer that will prolong the color for awhile. As I said, they are very sheer, so if you are looking more for a rich lipstick shade than just a tinted gloss, I suggested not throwing away your $18. You will be very unhappy. However, I love glosses rather than sticks, and these colors have done wonders for my extremely pale lips."	8/5/2010

"After reading the good to excellent reviews I purchased the dryer recently.  The delivery was speedy and all the parts were included.  My adult son, who's good at assembling things, put it together for me.  I'm African-American with long Locs that I roll-up on curlers and my hair dried evenly at a comfortable setting.  I had to place thick cushions on my folding chair, which is somewhat low,  to sit high enough for my head to be covered under the dryer.  I wasn't able to adjust the height locking knob to lower the hood.  I'll have to call on my son again.  I love the convenience of giving my hair a deep heat conditioning, rinsing, rolling it on rollers, then drying it with my own professional bonnet style hood dryer.  My curls were soft and springy.  I've only used it once and so far so good for the price, timer and range of heat settings, size of the hood, ease of use, and aesthetics."	6/19/2014

I've had mine for 3 months and my hair looks so silky and shiny!  My hair is very thick and frizzy/curly (slightly past my shoulders).  I used to have my hair professionally done (roller-set and blown out) every week when I lived close to my favorite hair salon.  When my husband and I moved, I couldn't find a salon that was close enough for weekly appointments, and it was just getting expensive.  I've had other standing hair bonnet dryers, but this is the kind I see most at professional hair salons, and for a reason.  It's fairly quiet (except for the ticking sound from the timer).  It goes up to 75 degrees Celsius, which is about 167 degrees Fahrenheit (very hot), but there is a dial that lets you adjust the temperature all the way down to cool temps.  I usually keep mine at 65 degrees Celsius (about 150 F).  There is another dial where you set the time and it goes up to a full hour, which is what I need.  I don't have to worry about keeping track of time as the dryer turns off automatically with the time you set.  I just roller-set my hair, set the timer, and read or nap until the dryer stops.  I love it!  Caveat: While assembly is easy, it was not so smooth to do.  My husband had to re-order replacement parts because they did not fit together properly the first time.  Still worth it, if you have the space to store it!"	1/17/2015

I previously had a Revlon with retractable cord that still worked, but it was REALLY hot. I have oily hair, so I have to wash it pretty much daily. The heat was killing my long hair. I took a chance on this and I am really glad I did. Initially, I was disappointed, but I am glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />1) Power! It has almost too much power for someone with long hair, my hair was FLYING all over the place (it also tangles easily). I added one of the 3 concentration nozzles and that really helped.<br /><br />2) Heat! Yes, its not super hot -- but heat isn't good either! It does start off rather cool, but it always heats up more about 30-60 seconds into blow drying. With as much power going through it, I don't think you need as much heat to accomplish getting dry hair.<br /><br />3) Buttons! Yes, the buttons are on the side. I think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers. It takes some time to get used to a new one. I think people notice the difference a lot at first, but it really will go away and you'll get used to it. It hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this blow dryer. I can't say that my hair dries any faster than my previous dryer, but it will be much healthier in the long run and that's something I appreciate more than speed. It definitely does not take a long time by any means though. I am happy I got it!"	2/11/2015

"I have never had a blow dryer this amazing before, I don't even know where to begin.  The first thing I noticed was this blow dryer is a little heavier than my current blow dryer....I guess that's what it takes to be such a phenomenal blow dryer! It's not so heavy that you won't want to use it, and it's surprisingly compact.<br /><br />You get two attachments, a concentrator nozzle, which if you've never used one before is amazing for keeping your hair smooth and silky.  You get a finger diffuser as well; which is great for curly hair or waves without the frizz.  I've never been able to blow dry my hair and get curls that I love up until now.  Normally my hair is a big ball of frizz after blowdrying it, but I was able to get frizz free curls with the help of this diffuser.<br /><br />I straighten my hair frequently and for the longest time I had to let my hair dry overnight because blow drying my hair would just cause it to frizz and even using a straightener wouldn't get rid of the frizz.  Now I just use the concentrator nozzle and it really helps keep the frizz at bay when I want to blow dry it straight.  Quite possibly my favorite thing about this blow dryer is the fact that not only does it have a cool shot button, it has a COOL setting, I have A LOT of hair and holding down that cool shot button for my whole hair can be a pain, now I can just switch it to the cool setting. Overall, I love this blow dryer, it's the best one I've ever owned.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."	7/25/2015

I have super sensitive, fair skin and am slightly acne prone and after trying what seemed like every sensitive product under the sun without success I was desperate ( even Cetaphil gives me ruddy/blemished skin for pete's sake!). So my dermatologist suggested I try this Olay lotion (she called it the oil of old lady cream ha) and to my delight this stuff worked wonders beyond my wildest dreams! This lotion not only was light, non-greasy and proved a great foundation for liquid and powder makeup, but miraculously smoothed my complexion and lightened/erased my post-blemish marks and general ruddiness. I have received so many compliments on my complexion since using this product it's amazing! I highly recommend this lotion to anyone looking for a complete protection and rejuvenation of the skin and at less than $12 a bottle, who could resist!?"	3/11/2010

I hate to give the blow dryer a bad rating but I have no way to rate the seller any longer and I NEED you all to see this review!  This is my second Elchim dryer and my first one is still going strong after 7 years.  The one I purchased only 5 months ago from this seller, stopped blowing hot hair and according to Elchim...there is not much help because Amazon is not an authorized seller of Elchim.  I contacted this particular seller with no response (big surprise) and noticed just today that they changed their &#34;business&#34; name.  I noticed amongst the reviews that I am not the first situation like this.  The Elchim rep told me it is possible these are either not authentic Elchim dryers or they could possibly be selling them as refurbished.  I will have to pay to ship the dryer to Elchim so they can determine.  I will be doing this since I spent over $80 bucks on the dryer.  In a nutshell, save yourself from any hassles IF the dryer goes bad and buy directly from an authorized Elchim seller."	12/5/2013

It is pretty quiet too. I wish the detachable nozzle went on easier & was a little longer. My only complaint is regarding the length of the nozzle. They call it the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment. When I am styling my bangs or blowing out my hair with a round brush - it makes the dryer too close to my head / hair and it makes styling more difficult.  My last hair dryer's attachment was longer with an air flow vent - to keep the air from blasting you in the head. I guess this will take some getting used to. Other than that - seems to be good quality. The plus is that it does dry my hair faster and with less noise.	1/23/2013

My hair stylist noticed it and couldn't figure out what was wrong. After about 9 months, I switched back to my old hairdryer and my hair was instantly healthy and shiny again. Maybe this hairdryer is good for some people but it was bad for me, and costly!     This comment above sums it up for me as well.  In the beginning you notice the shine which was great but after a few months I started to notice that my hair was losing it's shine and bounce.  I now went back to my old blow dryer that I had in storage and my hair is bouncy again and the shine is coming back slowly but surely.  I believe this blow dryer doesn't work for all hair types.

My only problem with the hair dryer is that it is somewhat too powerful to use the diffuser if I want to dry my naturally curly hair into curls.

Since I have relatively short hair, I use this product primarily for my daughter (6 years old).  She like many other children is picky about who dries her hair, and how her hair is dried.  She is blessed with hair that when blow-dried looks beautiful, but unfortunately the process requires working through the many knots she routinely achieves in her hair.  I've found that this hair dryer dries her hair faster than hair dryers that I have used previously.  Its a great hair dryer, its dual action fans give out more air, thus drying hair faster than ever before.  This has been a great addition to my routine because it helps accomplish the task a lot quicker than with other hair dryers.  The hair dryer has several settings, and when on the high setting I can dry hair in less than 5 minutes, which is fantastic for me.  I've been pleasantly surprised by this hairdryer."	12/15/2011

It dried my hair slightly faster than my previous dryer, and left it frizz free. I have very fine hair, so it almost always gets poofy. The tapered end made it easier to target the air to the rolling brush, which makes a big difference when compared to a snub nosed dryer (those aren't professional beauty terms, just the best words I can think of to describe the product). It's a decent size and easy to store. The motor is VERY quiet compared to other hair dryers I've used. My boyfriend gets up an hour later than I do for work, and he definitely appreciates the quiet motor.<br /><br />The bad: Just an aesthetic thing, it smells weird. To be fair, it's brand new so it's probably the smell from the packaging; but it also produces a faint odor when the motor runs that reminds me of like a toy blow dryer. I'll update the review if the smell goes away. For it's average size, it's fairly heavy. I'm not sure if it's because a larger motor, heavier materials, etc. I was using it for about 10 mins and my arm started to get sore! It's not insanely heavy, definitely manageable, but I would give it a higher ranking if it was a lighter and easier to hold. Also, the controls operate opposite any dryer I've ever had. So, instead of sliding the control up to get a faster speed or hotter temp, you slide down. That has definitely taken some getting used to. Finally, the attachments are just OK. They connect to the dryer well, but if you're like me, you are kind of a klutz when blow drying your hair. I usually knock the dryer with my brush or my hand at some point during the drying process and the attachments fall off at the slightest bump.<br /><br />Overall - it does what it says it will and does fine for what I paid for it. In hindsight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.ight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer."	7/25/2015

"My wife has been using this hair dryer for about a year now with no problems until today, when the dryer motor exploded in her hands and she was nearly electrocuted when she tried to unplug it. Reading some of the other reviews, I see that she was very lucky - the casing remained intact and the tiny sharp pieces of the motor remained inside the unit rather than turning into dangerous shrapnel. The Andis 82075 Tourmaline/Ionic Hair Dryer is a poorly-designed, dangerous product that should be taken off the market."	10/17/2012

"My Revlon hair dryer started sparking and died in January, a few days after the one-year warranty expired (yay! not.) so I needed to find a quick replacement. I've been pleasantly surprised with this dryer so far! I have very thick hair that usually takes forever to dry, even with a dryer, but this one is nice and light and doesn't make my arm feel like it's going to snap off after holding it for a few minutes. Probably the smartest part of the design is the honeycomb pattern over the back--it's pretty much impossible for my hair to get through it and get stuck in the blades. That makes drying much easier, since I can move the dryer through my hair without worrying about sudden-onset baldness and pain.<br /><br />It's not too loud, and it's definitely quieter than my old dryer. My only minor complaint is that the nozzle (is that what it's called? the duckbill-looking thing that concentrates air) will occasionally fly off in the middle of drying. I'm not sure if that's force from the air, or from moving the dryer around, but it's not quite as secure as it could be. Other than that, I'm completely satisfied with this dryer--and the fun color is a plus, too!"	3/13/2015

"UPDATE 10-5-2011: This dryer went POP, began to breathe fire and emit noxious fumes. To say it died is incorrect; I turned it off....permanently. It had a lifespan of three years and five months. Is this acceptable for a hair dryer that costs about $150.00? Not as far as I am concerned. My next investment in hair dryer futures? [[ASIN:B002JSL6QI Babyliss BABTT5585 TT Tourmaline 3000 Hair Dryer]].<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: The hair dryer like the toaster oven, the cell phone, and the corded telephone all are built with obsolescence in mind.<br /><br />My mother owned a chrome Oster hair dryer that lasted for 26 years. Sure it weighed about 10 pounds and didn't have a concentrator-nozzle, but it was built to endure. The Oster dryer fit into a stand and had an optional plastic hood that would go over your head to dry your curlerd hair. Those were the days!<br /><br />I have owned maybe 15-20 dryers so far. They last a year and then they go pop and die.....usually at the worst time imaginanble, but that's a complelety different story.<br /><br />About a year ago, I read a review in Allure Magazine about the Bespoke Labs Tourmaline Dryer. The T3 model Allure claimed, dried your hair 60% faster, didn't dry out the hair shaft and left your hair luminous and fabulous. Just like a movie star.<br /><br />Being in the market for another dryer, I decided to invest in the Allure recommendation. It was about 3x more expensive than the crappy dryers I was used to but if it made my hair better it would be worth it. Or so I reasoned.<br /><br />So far, the dryer has been proficient.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The dryer is very lightweight.<br />-Its well balanced and easy to hold.<br />-I have very thick, wavy-straight hair and the dryer allows me a blow out in about half the time.<br />-The heat seems to be very consistant. Even if you use the dryer for a length of time, it doesn't get hotter.<br />-It is relatively quiet.<br />-There is a mesh screen that you can remove and clean so the inner workings don't get gunked up.<br />-It comes with a nozzle that is easy to rotate.<br />- There are no open ports that may suck in your hair. Gosh don't you hate getting your hair stuck in your dryer?<br />-The cord is a good, generous length, 114 for even the most out of the way electric outlets and there is a handy velcro strap for binding the cord into a neat package. Also thoughtful, a loop has been provided should you want to hang the dryer on the back of your bathroom door.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two settings. The high setting is way too hot to use! Unless you have asbestos hair.<br />-The handle is very short. The on/off rocker switch and cool shot switch are just where I want to keep my fingers. I am constantly accidently pressing the off button while I am moving the dryer. This is very irritating. This is my biggest gripe with the dryer.<br />-I don't see much of a difference in the frizz department. I purchased the optional diffuser and my hair seems to be as frizzy as ever, tourmaline or not.<br />-My hair is still not luminous and movie star perfect. Sob.<br /><br />So far, the dryer has lasted. I doubt I will get 26 years of use, but lets see what happens.<br /><br />-rotate.  - There are no open ports that may suck in your hair.

"This is a really neat, compact hair dryer. It dried my shoulder length hair pretty quickly.  I did not use the concentrator nozzle for getting my hair dry, but I did use the thin nozzle with a round brush for styling purposes.  I really liked that this hair dryer has 3 speed settings, 2 heat settings, and a cool shot function.  I used all 3 of these.  The cool shot function is probably my favorite, it really &#34;sets&#34; your style in place.  The hair dryer is pretty light and the handle is ergonomically designed to feel good in your hand, and it does.  I do have to mention that the first time I used it, there was a distinct burning smell, I was a little concerned about it, but after about a minute or so into use, it stopped and I haven't noticed it again since.  Also, the cord on this hair dryer is THICK, as in it is not going to twist and kink up, it is a quality cord that it going to last a LONG time.<br />  All in all, this is a really good hair dryer,  If you are looking for something on the smaller side, something lightweight, that does a great job quickly, this is a good option.<br /><br />ANEMONE Wind Flower Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer provided by XTAVA."	3/27/2015

I was impressed immediately with this dryer.  It is beautiful.  It is slightly heavier than my last one,  but it cut drying time considerably so I don't think this will be an issue.  It has three speeds.  It has three temperature settings. The highest is hotter than any blow dryer i have ever used.  I just dried my hair with it and my naturally wavy hair is so straight that I don't need to break out my flat iron. Yes, I am amazed by this thing! The medium heat setting is equivalent to my last dryers hottest setting.  I have twin daughters that are young and I think the only setting cool enough to dry their hair with is the lowest heat Setting. This dryer is so powerful,  yet a ton quieter than my previous dryer. My husband even commented on how quiet it is. My husband also liked the fact that it is heavier.  Being a mechanic he said it probably has a stronger,  more durable motor. I was reading the booklet that was included, and this dryer has a four year warranty.  That's pretty astounding considering the price point.  I love this dryer,  and I'd buy it again in a heart beat.  I'm thinking about buying another one to store,  because I seriously love it that much!  Go buy it!"	5/12/2015

The hair dryer itself is very sturdy (and a bit heavier than most) and the controls are easy to use.  But is it possible that a hair dryer can actually have too much power behind the air flow?  If so, this hair dryer would fit the bill.   The Remington is a work horse of a hair dryer that has so much power for air velocity it was almost more than I would have preferred.  It blew my hair in just about every direction imaginable, and it blew papers on the ledge in my bathroom all around the room.  So therein lies what might be a potential issue with the hair dryer.  If you are a person who likes to style your hair with the help of your hair dryer, it might be a challenge to find a setting to do that.  While using the high speed setting on the hair dryer, with a round brush, my hair tended to blow around too much, and made it hard to control the hair in the brush.  The low setting was a better option, however, when I chose to use the cool shot option to set the hair, it made the hair dryer speed go faster, and blew more air than if you left the button untouched.  I am not sure why the airflow would increase when you hit the cool shot button, but that is what happened every time I pushed it.  It almost seems to be an engineering oversight.  Anyway, after a few days, I gave up on the Remington, for styling specific challenges only, and went back to using my Tourmaline Tools hair dryer, which I like very much.  If ever there is a time I just need a quick blow dry, I would certainly reach for this hair dryer, and it is more than suitable for general every day use."	12/14/2010

Buy $11 worth of lottery tickets, donate the $11 to charity, buy ice cream, anything else.... just don't waste your money on this junk!!!!!<br /><br />Honestly, I LOVED this little dryer for 6 weeks (just after the return period ended), now i have to throw it in the garbage!  The only issue i had with it (when it was working) was actually just an inconvenience/design flaw - as another reviewer said:  The buttons are on the inside of the handle and are the toggle style. You have to hold it just right so you don't turn it off or change the heat setting.<br /><br />THEN IT DIED - - -  DEAD, DEAD, DEAD!<br /><br />I was amazed that this hair dryer could sell for $11, it even comes with a diffuser and other accessories. I only used the dryer every other day for 6 weeks (so about 21 times) for about 5 - 10 minutes (max) each time...  I thought i was getting a cheap dryer, but overall it was VERY expensive:  If I bought a new $11 dryer every six weeks, that would be over $100/year - I could spend half that on a really nice hair dryer that would last years!<br /><br />The return policy expired but i could mail it to Conair ($12 postage) along with a check for $7.00 and then wait weeks for them to decide if they wanted to repair it or replace it (maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't).  So, then i would have $30 into a hair dryer that, if they choose to replace it, would be replaced with the same junk that would last another few weeks?????  I am not that stupid, I will cut my losses at $11.<br /><br />I know that so many other people have had the same problem with the short lifespan of this dryer -  i wish i had taken the time to read all the reviews.<br /><br />Conair & Amazon should stop selling these items, they know they are junk - that's why they offer them so cheap & that people are going to buy them because they are so cheap.  Conair doesn't have to worry that anyone would be stupid enough to take them up on their warranty (and flushanother $20 down the toilet) and Amazon, must figure that most of the dryers will work long enough that it isn't their problem!"	7/25/2014

Well if you have fine straight hair do yourself a favor. Don't purchase this. My  beautiful blond hair is so limp from it that it has become a waste of time using it. I tried numerous times not to put anything in it such as styling  products but it did not make a difference.  My girlfriend who has thick curly hair whom I considered just giving it to her if she liked it said she  didn't like it at all! It's too late to return it which is definitely my own fault. I am looking for something else to replace it with but I am a little  hesitant to purchase over the internet.	7/5/2010

I had been impressed with my hair stylist's hair dryer, but I knew such an expensive unit was out of my budget. However, I was willing to spend a little more than $20 on a drugstore hair dryer that, hopefully, would last a bit longer this time. I have very short, very, very fine hair. When it was longer, I used to require a diffuser since it is naturally wavy; however, with my current pixie cut, I knew I only really needed a unit that came with a concentrator nozzle. Because of the short-length and fineness of my hair, I also wanted a unit that had a good range of temperatures and speeds. A lot of what's available on the market now is too hot and too powerful for my hair. I did a bit of research for hair dryers that matched my criteria and finally settled on this. The extremely positive reviews left by other Amazon customers gave me confidence I had made a good decision.<br /><br />Happily enough, turns out I was correct! This unit feels solid. It is well-constructed, and doesn't have the &#34;hot spots&#34; like my old Con-Air did that caused its paint to flake off everywhere. It is a touch heavier than my old dryer, but I like the way it feels in my hand. The bit of added weight does not make the unit any more difficult to use. It is also powerful! The motor on this dryer is of much better quality than any I've used previously, causing an increase of air throughput that allows the unit to dry hair very quickly. Paradoxically, this unit performs much better than any 1875 W hair dryer I've ever used, and yet it is much, much quieter, and range of airflows gives it finesse. It comes with 3 different temperature settings and 3 different airflow settings, and I have found the medium temperature and medium airflow to be perfect for my needs. If you use the highest temperature setting, it will get hot! So if you need the high temp and high power, it is definitely there for you. It also comes with a concentrator nozzle, the output width of which in my opinion, is the perfect length. Some nozzles tend to be exorbitantly wide, which is probably fine if you have a lot of hair. But the output width of this nozzle is only around 2&#34;, perfect for a shortie like me.<br /><br />What more can I say? I am extremely happy with this purchase. It does arrive in a box that looks like it came straight out of the late 80s/early 90s, which I just found to be humorous. It is very no-muss, no-fuss, and I don't even think mine had packaged instructions with it. But it works just as well as my stylist's professional dryer and at a terrific price point. I would buy again in a heartbeat (but hopefully I won't have to, at least for a long, long time)."	7/23/2015

This one has a position that reads &#34;Hot&#34; but, it falls short of that. I'm assuming because of our litigious society and that someone might drink a blazing hot cup of McDonald's coffee while using this hair dryer.

I discovered the Remington Jet Dry Turbo	"If you have hair that takes FOREVER to dry, this is the hair dryer for you.  It not only dries your hair, but leaves it soft and shiny. I have personally gone through about 15 different hair dryers to find the perfect one.  I discovered the Remington Jet Dry Turbo about 10 or 15 years ago (it used to come in bluish/purple). During this time, I've often looked for other models just to see if I could find something better, and there just isn't anything.  Many times, you'll find me using two hair dryers at the same time (which often causes the bathroom circuit to overload). I used stylist models that cost around $150 (Bespoke, Rusk Speed Freak, etc.) to Consumer Reports Best Hair Dryer - which I think the people who are reviewing them don't have lots of hair... because nothing holds a candle to this model.<br /><br />They also have a compact one that I keep in my gym bag.  It's not as good, but will do in a pinch."	12/27/2014

"Overall, I'm quite happy with this hairdryer. I didn't give it a 5/5 because I'm not quite raving--it didn't transform my hair, like some people claimed, or dramatically reduce my drying time, but for the price, this hairdryer is a great value and I think I'll be using mine for quite some time to come.<br /><br />I've owned this hairdryer for about a month now. Here are my impressions:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Doesn't get as hot, but dries my hair in about the same amount of time as my old (non-ceramic, non-ionic) hairdryer (if anything, a little faster). Lower heat is less damaging to my hair, so since this dryer still gets it done just as quickly, that's a good thing in my book!<br />- Has three heat settings and two intensity settings, allowing for lots of control.<br />- Has a cold shot button that functions well.<br />- Retractable cord is very convenient for traveling and storage.<br />- Design is sleek and attractive.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I wish the cord were just a little longer. Maybe I'm asking for too much, but this one seems a little shorter than my last, and I find myself pulling on it fairly often.<br />- The hairdryer is a bit heavy, but nothing unmanageable. Get that arm workout!<br /><br />I haven't used the diffuser or concentrator attachments, so I can't give an accurate review of those. But just out of the box and unmodified, this dryer has proved to be a good purchase for me."	4/5/2013

I saw this Conair and decided to give it a try.  It works great and the diffuser is a good one.  It fits well into my suitcase, taking up little room.  I can't use hotel hair dryers because they do not have diffusers so this Conair is a great answer to my hairdo needs.  I have very wavy and thick hair and I like to have it curl.  To do this I need a diffuser and this hair dryer comes with one.  It's a little difficult to attach the diffuser but once attached it's stable and does not come off.  (On other hair dryers I've had the problem of diffusers coming off while I'm in the middle of drying my hair).  I highly recommend this hair dryer as an alternative to the larger ones, or as a second one to use while traveling."	9/2/2012

"My last hairdryer bit the dust and I was looking for something powerful and inexpensive to replace it.  It was also a Conair 1875, perhaps 5 years old.<br /><br />This Conair is quite a bit lighter and quieter but just as powerful.  My hair is very thick and I was concerned it would take too long to dry my hair.  It actually dries a little faster.  I also have been using the Cool button to finish off drying a section and it seems to reduce frizziness and makes my hair look a little smoother.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the location of the switches.  They are toggle switches, placed on the handle right where you grip the handle with your palm.  It is quite awkward to grip this and not flip the switches.  Quite a pain.  I wonder if anyone actually tested the design of this hairdryer before putting it on the market?  Its pretty annoying.  I have been able to hold it at an awkward angle to get my hair drying done."	5/20/2014

This one dries my hair in 15 - 30 minutes. It leaves my hair looking and feeling fabulous. It gives my hair more volume and straightens my hair better than my other dryers.

I bought this one for my mother because she was dying for it since I got it and it worked so well. I bought mine in 2009 and it is still going strong! I have pretty thick long hair, about chest length, and this dryer is by far the best one I've ever had. I always bought Conair in the past but saw this on sale and decided to get it to travel with. It ended up replacing my full size dryer because it works better than my big Conair, dries my hair super fast (5 minutes or so) and is really light. I dry my hair almost everyday in the winter and only a couple times a week in the summer to give you an idea of how much I use it and it still works like a charm. Revlon for me from now on.<br /><br />Summary- best little hair dryer you will buy. Powerful, light, and great value!"	6/24/2013

"This is the only diffuser of this variety I've ever found that has short fingers.  Normally the fingers are so long that it is impossible to get the heat close enough to my hair to not take forever to dry.  (I hated those long fingers when I had long hair, and I still hate them now that I have short [not even to my chin] hair!)  This diffuser does blow hair around a bit more than a traditional diffuser (for example, the old school ones w/ the black foam-like material), but this doesn't bother me since my curls are uneven in texture and lend themselves to a beach-y, messy type of look.  Might cause frizz for tight curls, though."	11/6/2014

In using it for the last couple of months, the force of air flow has weakened substantially to the point where I need to purchase another dryer. My obvious choice will NOT be this one.  It appears to have a plastic fan which may limit its longevity.  Also, the wide opening on the blower end makes it harder to focus on a particular area making it difficult to control what section of hair is styled and what's not. In the past, the dryers I have purchased lasted at least a couple of years.  This one was a great disappointment!"	3/11/2009

I was pretty disappointed right away by the 'hot' setting - didn't feel very hot to me. The only time the air actually felt hot, rather than warm, was when I turned the setting up to 'high' - and then I had to work so fast to dry my hair that if I made a mistake, I would have to wet my hair and start over again! The 'high' setting is no joke, it really moves the air. But I can't use it every day or else I'd look like I just walked out of a wind tunnel.<br /><br />Also, I didn't find the switches very easy to use, especially if my hands were even a little damp - was hard to get a good grip (maybe I'm just a weakling?). I much prefer switches that actually protrude from the handle that can be flipped with your thumb, if that makes sense.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not totally useless, I just had some issues with it. I will say the concentrator and diffuser attachments are great, but with the heat/speed settings, just not a good match for me."	7/8/2013

(Med-length wavy hair)	"I realized a bit too late in my adult life that a good blow-dryer makes all the difference in the look and feel of your hair. I simply could not figure out why my hair was always kind of &#34;sticky&#34; and not quite fully dry when I got out of the shower and tried to dry my hair with my 5+ year old Conair that I bought at CVS very inexpensively.<br />I did some research online and scoffed at the $150+ dryers that were being promoted. This one was on the list, and honestly, given the relatively lower price point versus the other professional dryers, I was willing to try it out.<br />WOW. I have used it now about 3 times, and it is hard to believe what a significant difference I see in my hair. I styled it myself for a formal Gala event, and was able to achieve the shiny look, feel, and volume in my hair that any professional stylist could achieve. It was unreal. Even on a work day I feel so much better about myself having simply styled my hair with this blow dryer.

Even when I've used the highest settings on it, it takes me twice as long to dry my hair with this Remington than it does with my [[ASIN:B003521CA2 Conair 259 Infiniti Pro AC Motor Styling Tool, Orange]].  I have wavy/curly hair, so I usually use a diffuser, but I've tried this both with the diffuser and without it, and each time it's taken me awhile to dry my hair.<br /><br />Some other pros of this dryer are that it has a nice feel to it (the material that it's made out of has a pearlescent, matte finish), isn't too heavy (so your arm doesn't get too tired while holding it), and comes with some nice attachments.  The diffuser, though, has prongs that are asymmetrical in length, so it takes awhile to get used to using it.<br /><br />Since many of the other reviews are glowing and say that this dryer dries in record time, I'm wondering if I received a defective unit. As I mentioned, it does cut down on frizz, but I prefer my Conair for a faster drying time."	11/25/2010

Sure, it dries efficiently, and I like the retractable cord feature (which you sometimes have to coax along, and the cord is too short), but I bought this hair dryer for the concentrator-the attachment that allows you to dry a very small and specific are (like at the salon). It just snaps on, instead of having a twist lock or something-which means if you so much as tap it (say, with the brush you're using to style), the attachment flies off. EVERY SINGLE MORNING.

It did not get super hot (which was good for the window kit), though I have no idea if that's good or bad from a hair drying perspective. I could have bought a cheaper hair dryer, but I chose this one because it is tourmaline ceramic, ionic, has several attachments, and multiple settings including a cool breeze setting -- all with the idea that after I was done using it on the window kit, I could provide it to female guests. This turned out to be a good idea, since my housemate's younger sister is currently visiting, and she was happy that I had a hair dryer for her to use. I asked for her opinion, and she says, &#34;It's great.&#34; Pressed for more details, she says, &#34;I like that it has a lot of different settings.&#34; As it turns out, this is in fact the first hair dryer she has ever used.

"Any girl/women will fall in love with the look of this dryer. Its definitely made to impress anyone who is looking for a product that works and looks great too. I bought it for the same reason. I own a Remington Straightener and almost can't live without it. This one compliments it perfectly.  The weight of the dryer is perfect. It does not feel heavy and is comfortable to work with. I wash my hair almost daily and this dryer comes in handy every time. It comes with bonus diffuser and concentrator attachments. I have very thin and fine hair and the diffuser seems like its made for a person with thick hair. Its too big for my hair.   The features that I love in this product are:  1. It has a removable air intake screen which make cleanup so easy.   2. Its sleek design and light weight.  3. Long cord and heat settings.  Features I wish were addressed:  1. It makes a lot of noise and my husband always complaints about that.  2. Though the cord is long and convenient for usage, its difficult to store because its not retractable.  Overall its a great buy and I can see myself using it for a very long time."	11/15/2011

If I was looking for faults I think they might look at how the hand held blower fits the wall bracket.  It is somewhat of a tightfit.

I went to Italy so I set the switch for 220v before I left so I wouldn't forget.  The first time I plugged it in (with an adapter), I double checked to ensure it was set to 220.  I switched it on low and it was working fine.  I then switched it on high, and within seconds it became red hot.  I looked at it and immediately pulled the plug as it was just about to shoot flames.  When I looked at the voltage, it had changed back to 110.  With the dryer unplugged, I set it back to 220 and toggled the hi/lo switch.  What I realized is that it worked fine on the low setting.  The moment the setting was changed to hi, it also changed the voltage back to 110.  Once I got this figured out, I used it on low for the entire trip with no issues.  Low was enough to dry my shoulder length hair."	7/5/2015

"I wish I had read further down the reviews before I bought this myself. I read the first few reviews at the time & everyone seemed to love it. Indeed, I loved it when I first got it, so much so that I bought a second one to have should this one burn out (that happened to me once on vacation!!).  Over time, I noticed my hair was becoming brittle and coarse and was thinning out.  I attributed it to a new medication I was taking.  My curly hair actually turned straight because of this medication and now I assumed my hair was continuing to morph into brittleness and falling out due to the meds. I also noticed that whenever my hair dresser cuts & blows out my hair, I have soft normal hair.  I thought it was her hair products that gave that result.  While ordering this as a gift for someone recently, I noticed the many negative reviews which described exactly what had happened to MY hair too! I bought a new different brand of hair dryer and my hair has now been restored to normal, soft shiny hair just like when my hair dresser does it.  While mine has never burned out or sparked, it does shoot out smoke now and then, but not often.  Stay away from this blow dryer.  It will ruin your hair."	7/9/2009

I wouldn't be surprised to see them adding a shunt resistor to increase the power drain so that the unit would appear to be even more powerful.  But, if they did, sooner or later the truth would be uncovered."	5/3/2013

"I love this dryer!  It is so much more powerful than the one that it replaced.  It doesn't cause my hair to frizz and I have been able to drastically cut down on the amount of flat-ironing I do.  It is somewhat heavy, but this is to be expected with the extra power that it provides and I really don't have a problem with the weight.  I love the heavy-duty, long cord it has too!  My only complaint is one that I have heard from other viewers - the control buttons are somewhat awkward.  I have had to get used to holding this dryer in a different way than I've always held all other hairdryers.  If I hold it in the usual way, it is extremely easy to accidentally push the buttons with your hand and inadvertently change the settings.  Other than this small issue, which I am already getting used to dealing with, I think this is probably the best dryer that I have ever used."	5/13/2015

Conair since I figure it's going to break within 2 years anyway why spend the extra cash? It's working great so far and is much quieter than the Remington and the air is softer so my hair doesn't tangle while I style it. It also doesn't get blazing hot.

I used a conair 1875 cord keeper on vacation so I added this to my wish list for Xmas. I have wavy curly somewhat course and frizzy hair which I blow dry straight. This makes my hair so soft and shiny that I have to use a volumizing gel to get any lift. I am using the included diverter with it, maybe that is making the difference. With previous hair dryers I would have needed to flat iron to get it this smooth. It did take a while to get used to the weight, it is heavy and the handle is at a strange angle that makes it harder to hold than previous hair dryers I've had. Also I really was surprised at how much power this draws, it blows the breaker if I have lights on in other rooms. My husband looked and said it draws as much power as our microwave! Generally I like the results, just wish it was more comfortable to hold and didn't blow the breaker. It seems to run less hot than my previous revlon 1600.

First, the cord is pretty short. It's about 3 feet, and 1/3 of it does not retract (by design); so, about a foot of the cord hanging even when you are not using the dryer. Second, the there's no temperature setting, and the temperature is very low. If you have long hair, it takes a long time to dry it. For the price, this dryer is not bad, but for these reasons, I bought a different dryer. This dryer is now in the guess bathroom."	4/23/2015

It works absolutely great.  I have very thick hair with natural curls.  Normally it takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to blow dry my hair and then I have to go over it with the flat iron to get it completely straight.  It took me ten minutes tops when using this blow dryer and it was perfect when I was done.  Not only was it straight but I was able to style it as well.  I have to say I'm shocked!!! and happy!!

"I ordered this Conair Hair Dryer back in June of 2012.  I have had many Conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them.  I would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed.  When my previous hair dryer died I again wanted a Conair since I had good luck with them so I ordered this one.  I loved this dryer all the way up until today.  While drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use.  My hair is not long, just below my shoulder, and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year.  I thought that maybe I just blew the ALCI so I followed the Operating Instructions to try and reset it.  No luck.  So I let it sit for a couple of hours to then try again....still no luck.  It is dead.  Again, I have had other Conair hair dryers that lasted for many years with no problems.<br />So because this particular dryer only lasting just under 13 months I am giving it the one star.  I haven't given up on Conair.  I will continue to buy Conair hoping my next one will last longer."	7/4/2013

"Not too long ago, I decided I'd better be proactive about having a replacement for my current dryer since I'm having to tap it on the sink to get it to &#34;click&#34; into the hot setting and start actually working.  I was surprised at the great reviews for such an inexpensive dryer, so I took a shot and bought it.<br /><br />This will remain in my drawer as a back up dryer.  It works well and is pretty quiet, but it just doesn't get hot enough or blow strongly enough to help me straighten my naturally curly but short hair.  My current dryer gets my hair pretty straight and then I use a straightening iron in spots.  I have to spend more time with the straightener with this blow dryer.<br /><br />If I were still wearing my hair longer and leaving it curly like I have in the past, I think this would be a 5 star dryer.  I would want a less-strong and hot air flow to prevent frizz.<br /><br />Still a good dryer and the price can't be beat!

I have used it several times this week and I am super thrilled with it. The heat can be set to low, medium, or high depending on your preference. I really like that. Because when the weather is hot, I don't always want to feel a hot breeze in my face. I prefer it to be medium or else I start sweating. My former blow dryer only had the hot setting, so this is a great advantage for me. Also this hair dryer is great because it has a cool switch, a button you can press to get a quick shot of cool air occasionally. I love that it has a wind controlling cone that can be added to the dryer for styling! I like to use a round brush to make the ends of my hair curl under sometimes while blow drying......but I don't want my hair blowing every which way lol. So this is just perfect. I really truly love this hair dryer. So happy with it. Works very well. Runs great. Makes my hair look beautiful. Mission accomplished. So glad I got to try this in exchange for a review."	1/9/2015

There were no fragments flying around the room, it simply locked up with unmistakable fumes of wire insulation roasting. The power surge button did it's job well by instantly shutting off.<br />This little hair dryer was used daily by several people,guests and visiting relatives for three years.<br />Visitors constantly remark: Where did you get this wonderful little hair dryer?<br />I ordered two more for my home this morning.<br />It's not quiet.

"I ordered this dryer to replace a &#34;Vidal Sassoon&#34; branded hot comb/dryer that had served me well for many years.  I wanted it because I really like the &#34;hot comb&#34; style.  After receiving it and noting the similarities with my old unit I would bet that Andis manufactured the dryer for Vidal Sassoon.  Not only was the design almost identical, but the comb and brush attachments were identical and, in fact, would interchange perfectly with my old unit.  If that is the case, this one should also last for many trouble free years.  It does have one design feature that caused some initial confusion.  The unit has three heat settings but there are only two fan speeds.  The fan operates at the same speed on both medium and high heat settings which makes it appear that the switch is not doing anything.  A check with my ammeter revealed, however, that the electrical load does increase a few amps and the air does get hotter in the high position.  I am not saying that this is any kind of a problem, but I just thought it unusual since my old one had three fan speeds.<br /><br />I would personally question the part about the &#34;ionic&#34; feature &#34;breaking up water molecules&#34; to accelerate drying but the ad writers gotta have something to do.<br /><br />At any rate, it was just what I was looking for and does a great job."	2/25/2014

"I searched and researched for a new hairdryer to replace my sad, old, held-together-with-tape dryer, and based on reviews, put this one on my wish list.  Finally, on Christmas, it was mine!  I love this dryer so much.  It dries my hair SO much faster than any other dryer - even some pricier ones I've used in the past.  The best part is that it doesn't leave me a sweaty mess when I'm done.  I don't know if it's just the air speed, or the well-designed air flow and concentrator, but even though it can blast some HOT air (I actually have to back it down to medium heat when I have the concentrator on), I am not dripping in sweat when I'm done blowing it straight section-by-section with my round brush.  This makes me so happy!  I can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than I've ever been able.  It's no louder than average.  It's no heavier than average.  But it works so much better than average.  I love how you press the cool shot button and it stays cool, then push it again and it goes back to hot.  No more holding it down awkwardly.  I have accidentally pressed it a time or two, but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge.   My hair is very fine and a bit wavy, and I have a LOT of it, so I really need a dryer that can get in there and start drying out the hair, especially in the back and at the crown, before I start sleeking it down with the concentrator, and this dryer can do it in minutes without me sitting around air-drying it for 20-30 minutes first.    Happy customer here!  Highly recommend this product!"	1/9/2012

"I live at altitude in Colorado, and hair dryers can feel rather weak because there is less air to push through.

The retractable cord works well and makes the dryer packable for travel. I've been happy with this dryer for 9 months until today.

This hair dryer worked great on both accounts!<br /><br />The turbo fan was excellent. It definitely dries your hair faster. I have fairly thick hair and it usually takes me several minutes to get my hair from wet (from the shower) to dry. The Remington D3710 cut my drying time in half. I also liked the turbo button that clicked into place so you don't have to hold it down the whole time.<br /><br />The settings are easy to figure: 3 heat and 2 speed settings with turbo. The dryer does not run hot at all. I usually like a hotter drying hair dryer because it seems to set my style easier. However, with the turbo speed, I didn't have any problems. In fact, I prefer it because it gives me more volume and doesn't leave heat damage.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the dryer is quite heavy and a little bulky (to accommodate the bigger fan).

"I had a hairdryer for over 10 years when I decided it was time to let it go and buy a new one.  I bought the Conair 223X Cord Reel Dryer in August 2010 at a large chain drugstore for about $35.  It worked fine and I had no complaints. I liked the sassy color and the retractable cord feature.  I have super thick hair that can frizz in humid weather.  I didn't see any improvement in frizz when using the dryer. I guess it dried my hair quickly, but I don't remember noticing that it dried it any faster than my pervious hair dryer.    Today I went to dry my hair and the dryer wouldn't work.  I pushed the reset button on the plug and it wouldn't reset. I pushed the reset button on my outlet and it was working.  I tested my outlet with other things and the outlet was working.  The tag on the plug said I should refer to the user manual.   I found it on Conair's website but it was not helpful (they actually had the wrong user manual uploaded to the hairdryer). So I called the number on the site, and a polite gentleman answered in less than one ring. I explained the problem, he asked me a few questions, and then looked up the warranty.  The item is under warranty for 3 years, so I am eligible for a new dryer. HOWEVER, I have to ship it to Conair's headquarters in Arizona, I have to enclose a note explaining the problem, along with the service # he generated for me, and then I have to enclose a check or money order for 3 dollars to cover shipping and handling of a new dryer to my home.     I'm really disappointed that after only 6 short months of very occasional use (i was only drying my hair maybe 4 times a MONTH) the dryer has stopped working.  I'm also disappointed that I have to go through a rigamarole to have the dryer replaced.  With today's technology, they could easily email me a voucher for a new dryer. They could also send me a prepaid shipping label and not charge me shipping and handling for a new dryer.      Maybe I just got a clunker, lots of folks like the dryer.  Just hope nothing goes wrong with it, or you'll be spending ten bucks to replace a 25 dollar dryer!"	2/15/2011

I now have sections of hair that have been burned off. Also, when I put my hair in a ponytail, I have hundreds of tiny short hairs sticking up because hairs were burned off. I also got 2 third degree burns on my skin.     I purchased the Featherweight first, took it back for the Evolution (thought maybe with more settings it would be ok). That's when I noticed my hair has been singed off. With the Featherweight, you have two heat choices, flame thrower or cold.     The hottest setting on the Evolution is the one that singed my hair off. The medium setting, isn't quite hot enough to get my hair straight. So, back this one is going too.     For what it's worth, my sister RAVED about this dryer and she bought the Evolution, AND the Featherweight, AND the travel one. She is made of money though and I think unless something is outrageously expensive, she gets it in her head it is worthless. Also, she always uses the diffuser and always does the curly look (probably on cool).     I will be sticking with the Elchim line, which I thought was outrageously expensive at $130 but now seems like a bargain. I'm going for the Da Vinci model by Elchim this time. All the best salons use Elchim. It's funny that $130 seems like a deal for a blowdryer now.     I purchased mine at Sephora. So, this review is nothing against Amazon.

Other than that i like the the item as a CG i choose to only use low heat on my hair with a finger diffuser to dry my hair. Which cuts my 8+ hrs (air drying) down to an hour (if i want it to be 100% dry) of waiting for my hair to dry. A couple of things that knocks this down to 4 stars instead of 5 is that you cant use the switches to keep it on a cool setting only the cool shot button, but holding down on that button while trying to get my entire head feels akward to me. Also, the finger diffuser that comes with it is tiny. I ended up purchasing a larger universal finger diffuser instead to cut down on the drying time."	5/15/2014

The dryer was um, well I didn't like it that much. Too make matters worse, the attachment began falling off with the slightest touch. That becomes very annoying since my hair is so thick.... Anyways, I received this dryer on Saturday which was the day it was supposed to arrive. I had missed the delivery, but I was so anxious to get it that I went to FedEx and picked it up. I ordered this along with the Denman Brushes Thermo Straightening Brush (D79) . So I am Black and I have 4b natural hair. I had been trying to straighten my hair for the longest. I also recently purchased a Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium 1.5-inch Steam Styler off of overstock.com, which I like way better than the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch I also purchased last year.<br /><br />So the whole point is, I really like this hair dryer so far. I wish I could have got the blue one but it cost almost $11 for shipping which made it not worth it. The color is very vibrant. O yea the main thing is, the dryer dries my hair very quickly.

The dryer has a nice heft to it and doesn't feel cheap, but isn't overly cumbersome either. It dries my hair very well, and seems to keep frizz to a minimum thanks to it's lower heat and air settings. The dryer definitely makes noise on high, but it's not as loud as most I've encountered, so for me it's a non-issue. The attachments included seem to stay put for me, I've had no problems with them falling off or coming loose while using the dryer. The switches have a solid feel to them, are well placed too, reducing the chance of accidentally changing the settings.     One difference I've noticed compared to other dryers I've used is when changing the heat settings on this dryer, the fan motor doesn't speed up or slow down any at all. With other dryers if you turn the heat up the fan sounds like it slows some, and turn the heat down the fan sounds like it speeds up a little. Perhaps that is one of the advantages of having an AC fan motor instead of a DC motor that is wired into the heating elements via a rectifier circuit in the hair dryer, less stress and voltage spikes/sags to shorten the life of the fan motor.    The only issues I could think of is the cord is not as long as I'd like it to be. Another 2 or 3 feet of length in the power cord would make a huge difference for the better.     The low heat setting on the dryer seems to be cooler than the low heat setting on all the other dryers I've used i.e. it's barely warmer than ambient air temperature. Whether that's a plus or a minus should be left up to the individual user. For me, it works better this way, so it isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I felt it worth mentioning."	5/7/2009

But when I tried to switch it to 250 volts before traveling,  I found it is poorly designed, poorly documented, and dangerous.<br /><br />First, the documentation does not make it clear that you MUST switch it manually from 125 to 250 volts.  From the other reviews I can see that many people will assume it will switch automatically (like most laptops and cell phone chargers).  It will not.  These other users apparently did not flip this switch and reported that it gets hot and noisy when they use it at 250 volts. This is expected and is extremely dangerous.<br /><br />The switch is horrible.  It has no markings to point to the 125 or 250 volt setting, so I had to guess.  Only by trial and error (and the fact that it was supposed to be initially set to 125 volts), did I figure out which was which.<br /><br />I needed to use a screwdriver to turn the switch because, unlike most devices, a coin will not fit in the slot.  So unless I would have brought my toolbox with me on my trip, I could not switch it (even if I was aware that you need to do so).<br /><br />After turning the switch back and forth a couple of times it broke.<br /><br />I am a mechanical engineer and I decided to take it apart to see if the design really is as bad as it appears.  It is.  Switching the badly documented, badly designed switch is really necessary to change the circuit from 125 to 250 volts and avoid dangerous overvoltage and overheating."	9/28/2014

It doesn't come with a diffuser, but I don't use one. It does however come with the vent attachment so you can direct the air flow. My son uses the dryer as well and likes it.

It's waist length, and thick. I used a plastic Conair Ion Shine 1875 hair dryer prior to buying this one. I could dry my hair with the Conair in maybe 15-20min. With the Remington, I can dry my hair in 5-10min! As for the less frizz the pearl ceramic plate is supposed to deliver, I think my hair is less frizzier... I have no idea if this is because of that, or because this dryer can sustain heat and air flow well enough to straighten my hair better.<br /><br />The colors are a bit off from the product image. The removable cap on the back of the dryer is a darker shade of pink, while the buttons and the ceramic plate are a lighter pink (but the product image's pink is a lot lighter). The unit itself is a dark maroon or purple-ish sort of color. It's not black. The material is not plastic. It has an interesting finish... smooth but doesn't slide around on a marble countertop like plastic does). The entire hairdryer is a bit heavier than I'm used to, but it's not too much of a big deal as long as you keep your hairdryer steady and you don't swing it about. Since it dries my hair in just a few minutes, the weight really isn't an issue. The cord is a decent length, but I use this at the sink, so I don't need a very long cord.<br /><br />I like the extra heat so I always have my heat set to the third level. The second level is probably better for finer hair. My hair is thick, so I like more heat. The first level is only slightly warm. It's just slightly warmer than the cold shot setting.<br /><br />As for the air speeds... I also like to use the highest setting. The second highest setting is just as fine, but if I'm in a rush, I blast the settings to dry my hair quickly. The air flow is very strong, so with finer hair, you're probably better off at a lower setting here as well. I noticed that other reviews have said they actually keep the hairdryer about 8in from their head to avoid burns. Just to give you a better understanding of my hair, I use the highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in. So much hair, and I like it long.<br /><br />Overall, hairdryer is heavy, but the heat and the air speed is fantastic for anyone with a lot of hair that's thick and long. Saves me time in the morning when getting ready, and my hair isn't as frizzy. Bonus points: After placing my order, I received this unit the next morning. I'm impressed with the Prime shipping speed with this one.highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in.

"This dryer is compact and worked fine for the first two months. After that the motor started going really slowly and essentially it can only be used on the High setting now, which barely goes as fast as the Low setting used to. Of course, Amazon only allows refunds for the first month. A waste of money, since I like drying my hair on High. It hasn't completely died yet (6 months later), but I'm not optimistic. Also, I took this to Europe, since it's adaptable to both 125 and 250 volts, and it was extremely difficult to change the setting from one to the other. When I turned it on in England, after changing the voltage indicator, it shorted out our US/UK plug adapter and didn't work at all. So I'm not convinced that it actually does change between voltages.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/18/14: It's dead, Jim. :-("	12/6/2014

You have one button to push to turn it on and then when you're done, just put the dryer back into its holder and it automatically turns off. Its easy to clean, and easy to change the wattage setting. I mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which I thought would not be a good thing, turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night. Having two heat settings as far as inside the dryer to save electricity is great for those that want a softer not as hot two-setting dryer or those that are trying to save money among other things.

Before ordering and receiving I was concerned it was a knock off because it was cheaper than the other two color options. I do think it is real. It works well. Feels well made. I looked at all of the instructions closely on the box for spelling/grammar mistakes which are common with fakes and found none. I've had about 2 months now and it works well.

It does have a large-ish plug which I assume is a transformer from AC to DC.  I love the color which is more intense than in the picture - think Granny Smith Apple. I thought it would be smaller than it is since it is sort of billed as a travel dryer.  The handle does an easy twist to fold so it fits in the accompanying bag.  I don't mind the size as it is powerful enough to easily dry my longish and very thick hair and most travel dryers are pretty feeble. What more can I ask?  It says it will last longer than most dryers which is great. It only has a few settings - Hi and low plus a cool shot override button - all I ever use anyway.	3/24/2011

The first retractable cord was great.  It dried my hair quickly.  This one is very different.  First the cord doesn't retract completely.  It didn't after the first week.  Then, this week the plug cracked wide open.  The cheap plastic just cracked.  I don't remember hitting it on anything, but maybe it happened when I tried plugging it into an old outlet.  Whatever happened, I've never had a plug crack wide open before.  Like many other new appliances on the market, this one is inferior to the exact same model we could buy 5 years ago."	6/22/2014

While blowdrying your hair, expect it to go flying and fall to the floor. Extremely frustrating and annoying<br /><br />2) The coord is very short.

The dryer feels solid and the materials are high quality, it's also much lighter than my 3200 (and smaller). I'm an editorial stylist and I'm hard on my tools but my twin turbos always last for years (and they're repairable). A few things to mention, the nozzles on my dryer are very hard to get on and hard to rotate when in place (perhaps they just need to break in?) Also this dryer has a shorter &#34;snout&#34; much like the 3500, so if you're used to having a more traditional dryer like the 2700 or 3200 it will take a bit of getting used to.

At first, after I bought it, I really liked how quickly it dried my hair. After using it every day for about 8 days, I noticed a strange smell, but didn't know what it was. (It didn't smell like burning hair, more like home perm solution.) I switched from high heat (which had been fine with my Conair) to the medium setting, and the smell went away, but the damage continued. I have medium length fine straight hair, and the ends became dry and frizzy and began to break off. After a month, my hair has turned to brittle straw, won't curl, and is breaking all over.  Also, I color my hair with semi-permanent coloring, and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring, giving a strange look. I realize now that this dryer was working so quickly because it was WAY too hot, even on the medium setting. Not sure if the ions were a factor, but it doesn't matter. After reading the other reviews here, I feel lucky not to have experienced sparks or flames. I'm getting a short cut and a new dryer and waiting for my hair to grow out. I'm extremely upset, and definitely will not purchase another Revlon product."	3/22/2009

It also heats up quickly, cools down quickly, comes with several attachments, and has a long cord.

"OMG I love this dryer.  I have thick short hair and asked my stylist what dryer to get next.  I had a cheap drugstore one that had lasted years but was on its last legs.  I have really hesitated to spend a ton of money on a dryer but went ahead and bought this since my birthday was coming up.  I read the reviews before completing the transaction and thought the people who said it dries their hair faster must be crazy.  How would one dryer dry hair significantly faster than another?<br /><br />The answer is I don't know, but it does.  It absolutely does.  I am a convert!  I LOVE this dryer.  I love how small it is.  I packed it on a trip recently and didn't have to stress about how much room it took up in my suitcase.  It is so compact and powerful.  I just adore it.<br /><br />I'm not great at reviewing products I feel strongly about so the fact that I'm even writing this should tell you something.  This dryer really is different than other dryers out there and the higher price is worth every penny.  When you can shave time off of your morning routine every single day, imagine how much of your life you get back?  Now, is that worth extra money?  I am a wash and go girl with little to no interest in makeup, fashion, etc.  I am a mom of three and own a small quilting business.  But I wash my hair every day and have to dry it to tame it.

"It's hard to believe a hair dryer could make a big difference but this one absolutely DOES.  I'm sooo thrilled with it!  My kinky/curly fine/thin hair has dried much faster than usual (even though it's the same wattage as my previous dryer) and so smooth, soft, shiny and healthy looking (getting that without a flat iron also means that it gets to stay fluffier looking instead of flat and stringy).  -- I found it cheaper at Walmart, but it says it's a LIMITED EDITION so if you can't get it there, get it here.  But GET IT -- it's great!<br /><br />One thing I have to have on my driers is separate controls for the heat and for the air - this does - and it has the cool shot button as well.  The really nice thing if you use the end attachment that condenses the direction of the air flow, is that this dryer has a round end (not oval) so you can turn the attachment when you need to instead of holding your arm/wrist in awkward positions to blow at a certain angle.  Yes!<br /><br />What this Amazon site does NOT show you is all the info on the side of the box, so I'll take a minute and copy it down here for you.<br /><br />MICRO-CONDITIONERS:  Get smoother, healthier hair. Say good-bye to heat damage and say hello to an enhanced healthy shine!  This specially designed dryer features a grill that is infused with microscopic conditioners.  These micro-conditioners release into the dryer air flow, and are transferred to your hair, helping to prevent damage and increase shine and hair health.<br /><br />IONIC TECHNOLOGY:  Negative ions are activated by the heat of the dryer to heal heat damaged hair as you style. The ions reduce drying time and infuse vital moisture into the hair, resulting in reduced frizz and static.<br /><br />CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY:  Infrared heat is produced by the ceramic coated grill to help prevent damage to the hair and allows for faster drying time.<br /><br />TOURMALINE TECHNOLOGY:  This semiprecious gemstone works in conjunction with the ceramic technology of this dryer, producing far-infrared energy which protects the hair cuticle from over-heating, preventing brittleness and cracking.<br /><br />What else do you need to know -- it honestly does what it says - and I LOVE IT!

It is not too loud - which is great if you suffer from hearing or headache issues.<br />I love the color.  It is extremely attractive.  It is a dark chocolate brown with a pinky purple accent.  Goes nicely with my bathroom decor.  OH!  AND THE BEST PART!  It does not hurt my hands!  It is ergonomic!  I feels like a dream!  It is a perfect fit in my palm and I don't feel the switches are in the way at all.

"It is a good thing that my limited edition Revlon blow dryer broke after only 6 months. Because I replaced it with the John Frieda full volume blow dryer this morning and I was simply stunned at the difference in quality. I have had many brands of blow dryers over the years and it has always taken me at least 10 minutes to completely blow dry my very thick hair. However this John Frieda blow dryer took my very thick, shoulder length hair from soaking wet to bone dry and ready for hot rollers in three minutes! Yes, you read that right... three minutes! This blow dryer is going to save me so much time when I am in a hurry and trying to get out the door. It is worth every single penny and then some. I love, love, love this blow dryer and highly recommend it!"	2/10/2013

"I was actually looking for something else when I stumbled upon this and thought &#34;why not&#34;.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have fine shoulder length hair and it did not take an hour to dry, as another reviewer stated.  (Of course, I didn't attempt to dry my hair when it is dripping wet either.  I wrap my hair in a towel and do other things for a while before attempting to blow dry.)  Anyway, I was worried at first because the packaging and most of the instructions are in Japanese.  But I used it on the lower voltage and it was fine.  I used the regular brush to dry my hair, as I'm not sure how to use the round brush yet.  I dried most of my hair and then used this upside down to give my hair some lift and bounce, which it did.  Also, my hair does not look frizzy, like it does at times when using a regular blow dryer (I believe because sometimes a regular blow dryer both damages and tends to tangle your hair).  My hair actually looks shiny as well as smooth (as if I flat ironed it).  I would give this a try if you are someone who likes the look of their hair when it is blow dried and/or flat ironed but with what seems much less damage.  I think you could get away with using just this dryer and a little serum (depending on how naturally straight your hair is). I am excited to use this and try to figure out the round brush too."	3/31/2015

It is very loud as I think one reviewer stated.  That I could deal with but that was just one small detail.  The attachment for the hair curling I could not work, although that may just be me.  The settings for the hot and cold on this are right at the finger tips where you hold the dryer.  Therefore, if you are not careful you will be drying on warm instead of high.  You start wondering why its not getting dry.  I have had to change it back as many as 20 times in one hair drying session.  And now the last and & most frustrating feature of the dryer.  The concentrated hair drying attachment that was stated in the description of the product as coming off for easy cleaning, unlike most other models.  Well yes, it does come off for easy cleaning alright, it just blows it across the room as you are drying your hair.  You just don't want anyone else in the room with you for you never know where the line of fire may be.  It blows off with quite a force so I am sure it would hurt someone, particularly a small child.  I owned a Vidal Sassoon Dryer before but never one like this.  I cannot recommend this product and will not purchase another one of this brand.  It was inexpensive so I guess its true, you get what you pay for.  Not worth paying return shipping so I use it as it is until my new one arrives."	4/10/2015

"There's a lot of low reviews for this hair dryer and most are because it's loud. Yes, it is loud. I don't use a hair dryer to style my hair I just want it to dry it as quickly as possible. I have long hair to my lower back, its (mostly) straight and very fine hair. I part my hair in the middle. Then turn it on to the highest speend and hot. I dry my left side in 5 mins then my right side- another 5 mins. This is the 3rd time I've bought this hair drier. The 1st one died when I dropped it. R.I.P. The second one just died after 5 years... It wouldn't heat up. 5 years for $20.. That's a good deal to me. If you're looking for a fancy hair dryer to carfeully and (apparently) silently... continue looking. If you're looking for a hair dryer that will dry your hear in 10-15 mins (if you have thick hair) then this one could be it."	2/14/2015

I have been using this every other day for a couple weeks and I haven't noticed any damage to my hair. It is also consistently the same temperature so I don't get a mix of warm / cold air. The cold blast button I think still works but I'll have to read the instructions again on whether you hold it down or just push the button. If it's that you just push the button, I don't notice it getting any cooler after depressing it. Other than the mysterious button, this has been great. It's easy to hold and doesn't slip in my hands at all. The cord doesn't wrap itself up while I'm using it, which was an issue with my last blowdryer. It was constantly coiling up when I lifted it. I do not wrap the cord around the body of my tools, so this was especially annoying. This is my first diffusing hairdryer, so I cannot compare it to anything else but I will say that when its last day comes, I am happy enough to buy the same product."	6/22/2013

If it's quiet, it's a big bonus.<br /><br />My favorite is this: http://www.amazon.com/Sharper-Image-Ionic-Conditioning-SI745/dp/B00007M1U2/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t , the Sharper Image ionic hair dryer. I like the travel version because it's light weight, yet delivers just as much power and air. Too bad this is no longer in production.<br /><br />I also enjoyed this: http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Infusions-Wahl-Pro-Dryer/dp/B001E6G6FC/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top , and I use it as my alternative hair dryer when I can't access my Sharper Image dryer. This one, too, delivers great air flow at an appropriate temperature and dries my hair quickly and gently.<br /><br />Now, to our product at hand... it's heavy compares to the two I had just mentioned. It's not any more quiet. I don't generally use the air diffuser on my Wahl, but I do use it on my Sharper Image. I tried using the diffuser with this Remington, but whether I use it or not, my hair gets very tangled afterward, which isn't a problem with neither of the two I had mentioned. It also does not dry quickly as the title implies, nor does it make my hair feel anymore healthy than before I use it. In fact, rather than taking half the time to dry my hair, I think it doubles the time.<br /><br />My hair is past the middle of my back, so it's a bit long. Maybe this is a great dryer for shorter hair? I don't know. I can't recommend this to others. On the bright side, I get a nice work out with my right arm using it... haha...<br /><br />Two stars, because it works."	12/31/2011

I bought the Blo & Go and I cant say enough as to how easy and convenient it has been for me. It took a few approaches with getting it on the mirror at first. You have to really push forward with a good amount of pressure on the suction area and then with the other hand press down the lever. But once you get the knack it really works.

It gets the job done and also comes with a diffuser and a concentrator.<br /><br />The barrel is very wide, moves plenty of air, and is one of the quietest hair dryers I've used, but also definitely does not have that strong of a fan. I don't mind this usually, but sometimes if my bangs are acting up I'd really like a large amount of air/heat to put them in place. Usually the concentrator is fine for this but it'd be nice to have a bit more flow.<br /><br />The diffuser is also very nice. I've never really used a diffuser until getting this but it generally keeps my thick, curly hair frizz free as long as I don't dry it completely. If I dry it 100%, then I definitely get some frizz on the top layer of my hair.<br /><br />Overall, very happy with this product for the price."	10/25/2013

On the bright side, this won't burn your hair & will dry without damaging your hair.  Personally, I like it.  Hubby complains, because he wants to turn on the dryer, sweep it over his head about 6 times and be finished.  No go.  What used to take him a minute now takes 3.  But I think his hair looks healthier.  He could care less : )  He's a man on a mission and wasted time frustrates him to no end.  Patience is a virtue, I say, as he rolls his eyes.<br /><br />It has two speeds (I use low).  It was easy to install; I did it myself in about 3.5 minutes (really easy).  You use 2 screws to screw a small metal plate onto the wall in your desired hanging location, within reach of an electrical outlet.  Then just clip the dryer body onto the plate, plug in, and DONE!<br /><br />The design's great, because the dryer can continue to cool, even after you hang it up, so you don't have to pre-cool it or worry about it overheating in its stand.  It has a nice little blueish-white nightlight built in, a pleasant plus.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Absolutely.  Do I recommend it?  Wholeheartedly for short haircuts.  I like it!"	5/25/2013

Every time I went to a hotel, I wrote down the brand with the intention of ordering one. Finally my old blow dryer went kaput, so I had an excuse to purchase this one.<br /><br />First of all, I don't know why the photo shows it somewhat pearly looking: it's plain old white. Second, it was a bit larger than I expected and so it wouldn't fit in the spot I had chosen for it. I ended up having to mount it above a towel bar since if it was below it would either be in the way of the light switches or it would have to under the hand towels and make an odd bulge. So I put it in myself--didn't use the anchors as I think it will stay in place without. I hung a little picture next to it so it wouldn't look so out of place above the towel bar by itself.<br /><br />It works just as expected and I love having it ready to go whenever I am. One advantage I discovered with mounting it higher is that it's never going to get caught on knobs or anything else--a frequent frustration when I'm tired in the morning. We had our first really cold day here (in the South) and I found it's also handy for warming yourself up quickly when coming out of the shower; I've suggested it to my husband for that purpose (he's bald and otherwise wouldn't need it).<br /><br />I'll update my review if I ever have problems with it, but so far it's great--just have to get used to seeing it there on the wall."	11/14/2013

"As a professional makeup artist and hair stylist I invest in a lot of products. This hair dryer is really not my favorite. I usually hold it by the base when I'm drying a client's hair but it gets so hot that I have to hold it by the handle, but when I do that I'm touching all the buttons and turning stuff on and off on accident. Also, the part that holds the filter on the back of the dryer keeps falling off that I had to tape it and now it looks terrible but it's the only thing that holds the piece on. Not to mention the metal grate on the back that holds the filter in keeps caving in constantly. I feel like these are not meant for travel, which is funny because it's travel size. Maybe I got a bad batch or something.<br /><br />Yes it's a powerful driver, but this seems more like it's aimed at a consumer than a professional which is sad because I had many professionals reccomend it to me. I wouldn't reccomend this to traveling stylists, but maybe it works better if you have your own station."	4/9/2015

Maybe its the &#34;ionizing&#34; function of the dryer, but it really did a number on my hair. I've been using Conair dryers for years and years, and when my last hair dryer died I bought another Conair, thinking I'd get the same great dryer. In terms of the dryer itself, it is heavy, difficult to hold, and the cord is too short (especially if you have long hair and attempt to style using a brush). Due to the weight and the oddly shaped handle, I found it very awkward to use. The buttons that control the heat/speed are also located in an inconvenient spot on the handle, and they are sharp on the edges, which makes using the dyer even more uncomfortable. Unless you want your hair to be a lifeless dried-out mess, stay away from this dryer."	2/11/2015

I find it very easy to use and that it gives me such the softest appearance with hair. I'm a College Student so I'm always on the go whether its going from class to class to traveling to yoga class/gym I definitely need something as flexible as I am. My hair is on the normal side, not too thick and not too thin. It is also fairly straight.<br /><br /> I feel that this hair dryer without the diffuser (black top) creates such a satin feel to the hair and that with the diffuser on my hair gets so shiny! So what I do is do about 2-5 min without the black top diffuser and 3 minutes with it on. The cool thing about this hair dryer is that it comes with 2 diffusers (one wide and one thin), it helps cater to your hair and what you want done to it. Overall this is an excellent hair dryer, everything form the Xtava line so far has been fantastic.

In fact, it made it look so flat and left my hair without any body.  My hair felt smooth and soft, but it didn't necessarily look that way. Even on the highest setting there's not a whole lot of power, it blows less air and doesn't get as hot as my previous dryer - I had an Elchim and it was definitely better.  Not sure if the wattage has much to do with it, this is 1875 and my Elchim was 2000.  But the 1875 should be fine for my hair since it's normal and not too thick. If you want the flat, straight-ironed look and have thicker hair, this might work for you.  For the price I paid, I wasn't impressed.  For the record, my sister-in-law's dryer performs much differently, even though it's the exact same model.  That makes me suspicious that perhaps this was a refurbished dryer or maybe even a fake if that's even possible. The box was not sealed, though the packaging inside was fine. I'd be interested to hear if anyone else had the same experience."	4/13/2012

Well, most importantly, it's 1875 watts dries your hair very quickly. I have shoulder length, straight, fine but fairly thick hair and this drier has it dry within 5 minutes. I was a little skeptical about the ion thing at first, but I have to admit that my hair does feel a little smoother and softer after using this dryer. What I like most about the dryer is that it has two rocker switches with lots of setting possibilities. One controls the high/low/off settings and the other controls the hot/warm/cold. It's nice that you can do them in any combination which makes for a lot of choices. I usually am in a hurry and use the hot and high settings. (Some day I'll start getting up earlier or start getting ready before the last minute, but until then, I need a dryer like this!) It also has a cool button so when you're styling your hair and have a section of hair wrapped around your brush to make it flip up or under you can hit it with the hot air first, and then the cool to set it before unwrapping it. This works so well and so quickly, that it's one of the first hair dryers that I can get away with not using a curling iron and still have my hair styled the way I like it.<br /><br />This dryer is very spacey looking in a silver gray color with a purple/blue racing stripe down the side. The cord is gray. I guess what my hair dryer looks like isn't that big of a deal but why settle for a drab looking one when you can have one with a little pizzaz? It comes with a diffuser and two other attachments for directing the air flow. The size of this dryer is pretty substantial, but it isn't too heavy, it's just a nice weight. I would say it's about average as far as noise goes. I've actually had travel sized hair dryers that were noisier than this one. All in all it's an excellent dryer that does exactly what I want it to do which is to dry my hair quickly and leave it looking soft and full."	7/30/2011

It's always a possibility that long hair can get sucked into the back end of a hair dryer, but because of the extremely small size, it happens extremely easily with this one. Especially if you flip your head upside down to dry it, you lose even more control. The first time it sucked some hair up, it lost significant drying force. The second time, it stopped working altogether. Not to mention the hair loss. It is, however, without a doubt, the most adorable hair dryer I've ever seen."	2/24/2015

I liked the first one I bought 2 or 3 years ago and it still works fine, using it 7 days a week.  This is fairly Compact, the handle folds up, the retractor works well but I always guide the cord back into the handle when I retract it (if you let it zip closed I believe it places more wear on the rewinding mechanism).  It does get fairly hot, has a cooler setting, plus shot of cold air, not too loud, and comfortable to grip and use.  It would be nice if it had a 240 volt built-in converter but the cost was slightly under twenty bucks and many foreign hotels in the west have built=in converters in their hotel rooms.  I was very pleased with the first one, still up and running fine, and the new one is as good as the old one.  My wife also likes it as she has very thick hair which takes a long time to dry.  She says for an inexpensive hair dryer this does better than most and drys her hair in a reasonable manner.  A number of hotels like Marriott buy this Andis, and others that look almost identical, to place in their rooms.  One manager stated that he usually keeps several on hand as customers frequently ask to buy one"	12/4/2013

On the day that my blow dryer finally died, I quickly purchased this model.  Sure, it has several speed and heat settings, but it's nothing special.  My itty bitty hair dryer from 2000 did as good of a job as the ion/ceramic/multi-function hair dryers of present day.  I don't think you're going to notice a difference in dryers until you really jump into a different price bracket with the T-3s and Chi's.  i think I could have spend about $15 less and still achieved the same look and quality.

I was happy with the end result but wanted to reduce the time spent.<br /><br />Researched the dryers to death and then just got fatigued and popped for the Sedu as it has tourmaline and ionic, and it has a regular plug-- I had some bad luck with those huge GF plugs on my hair iron.  The price is insane but since I use this nearly every day . . . .<br /><br />Compared to the Hot Tools dryer, this does not get hotter (which is a good thing because the Hot Tools is plenty hot enough to fry your hair), but it does blow more forcefully.  The dryer is small and easy to handle.  Did not find it at all heavy.  Was able to use the one dryer in one hand and brush in the other.  It still got my hair dryer faster than using the two Hot Tool dryers.  And much straighter and much smoother.  That was the surprise, and the reason I say I am a skeptic no longer.  Something about the dryer-- the tourmaline? the ions? really does make a difference.  Because my hair was already straighter by the time it was dry (since I could use the brush) the time spent using the flat iron was significantly reduced.<br />I hope that with in addition to reducing the time I have also reduced the trauma to my hair.<br /><br />I cannot tell if this is worth the big premium over the Solia and the SuperSolano which both look to be very nice dryers.  But I am very happy with the Sedu."	3/31/2012

"I've been using a John Freida 1875 watt dryer, which is heavy and tiring to use, because of my physical limitations.  I ran across this hair dryer, which I stored after buying the Freida.  The only reason I replaced it is because I was looking for a dryer with a cold shot.<br /><br />I used the dryer last night and it dries faster than the Freida 1825 watt dryer!  Since it's only 1200 watts, the dryer doesn't blow as hard.  It goes to reason that, since the air is not moving as fast, it will heat as well, if not better, than a dryer that blows you through a wall.  Since I have a lot of very fine, straight hair, which is shoulder blade length, it doesn't take much blowing air to tangle my hair.  Because of the decreased speed of the dryer, I had no problems with tangles, yet the time it took to blow my hair dry decreased by 1/3.<br /><br />My hair looked shiner last night than after using the Freida, which I attribute to the decreased wattage of the dryer. Also, the dryer is quieter than the Freida dryer."	12/12/2013

Girl friend is super happy how her hair comes out with this machine and that was the whole plan.  Also the pole is spring loaded which makes it easier to adjust up but harder-er to adjust down but you don't have to be super strong to do it.  It was easy for me just wanted to mention it because I thought it was a great selling point because if it wasn't spring loaded it would suck adjusting the height.	12/31/2014

The mid-heat setting, which i was really looking forward to ( having only 'unbearably hot' on my prior dryer) was actually pretty cool and the warm setting not really that warm. maybe that's something to get used to, but didn't seem to dry my hair that fast. the other issue for me was simply that the dryer was so much larger that it wouldn't fit in my vanity drawer, and with no other storage option, had to find a model that fit."	2/28/2014

Instead of staying consistently hot, it cycles through heat settings (including cold). The cord is also much shorter than before - a pain for tall women.

And it looks kind of a cheap plastic.    However, this blow dries my hair pretty fast. So, it does what's required of it!    I took one star off because it does seem louder than your average hair dryer. If you live in a house, that's probably not a big deal; but if your apt has thin walls... you might not want to blow dry your hair in the middle of the night.    I really like the fact that the cord is retractable. Word of caution: hang on to the plug when you hit the retraction button because it will fly all over the place. And if you're not careful, this can probably hit you in the face because it retracts very fast.    Lastly, a couple reviews have mentioned that this Conair 1875 is heavier than most hair dryers. My old hair dryer must have been pretty heavy too then because I don't really notice it. Either way, at least it'll give you a work out!"	10/15/2014

"This is the best hair dryer I've ever had:<br /><br />The size is not too large or too long--the picture makes it look larger than it actually is. It is light-weight. The handle provides a perfect grip. The motor cools down very quickly and the casing does not retain heat.<br /><br />The buttons are all you could possibly ask for--and they are very conveniently located right on the handle where your fingers wrap around it. You don't have to shift your grip or stop what you are doing to change a heat setting or blow setting. Don't think that your fingers could accidently trip a botton: They are raised buttons and have a definite angle and curve and your fingers have to purposefully push them one way or the other to make changes. The cold buttom works very quickly, too.<br /><br />There is a loop for hanging, a safety plug and a long cord.<br /><br />It has the normal attachments, PLUS a pretty nifty one that is suited for nice, long, fine hair. It will be able to help lift a large section of hair and shoot many channels of air into the section.<br /><br />Last, but not least, it is a beautiful thing to look at.

It's heavier then my red Revlon dryer and blue contair but it does a better job. I hated my blue dryer b/c I always had frizzy hair afterwards. The red dryer was like a someone blowing on my hair themselves no power at all. So far so good, I purchased mine at target, they have the dryers they sell on display so you can pick them up and feel the weight and shape I would suggest finding a local target that offers that before buying a new dryer.

"I've had an older version of this hair dryer for several years now, mine is a D 2009 - so I'm thinking that's when I got it. I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond. I fell in love with this hair dryer at once, and since then I get incredibly frustrated whenever I'm at someone else's house and don't have my own dryer! It's so bad that I often tote mine with me, and refuse to travel for a long time without it. I have long hair of medium thickness and people always think it must take me forever to blow dry my hair, but it only takes about 5-10 minutes with this dryer. It still works perfect, but after years of hanging it by the loop on the cord (I hung a hook on my bathroom wall specifically for this purpose) the loop broke, so I'm debating if I want to buy a new one even though this one still works great - if so it will just mean that now I will have a spare and won't have to carry mine to my parent's house."	1/2/2012

It only took my about 10 minutes to completely dry my hair. For me this is amazing because it cut down on my usual 1.5 process of doing my hair.  Oh and tried the oil and its just as great as the dryer leaving my hair feeling soft, shiny and healthy. The only downside was it was a bit heavy nothing one couldn't handle.

Also, it's hard to hold it by the handle because the rocker switches for power and heat are in the way of your fingers, so you have to practice in order to not change the settings during use. When set on hot/high, the velocity of the air is very good, but it's not hot at all -- the air is barely warm -- which is fine for drying, but certainly not good for styling. It did minimize my static flyaway hair, but since I had to use my old &#34;hot&#34; dryer to style, I lost that benefit and had to add leave-in conditioner to de-electrify my hair.

"My hair has never been shiner and instantly silkier! I was honestly shocked. I used to blow dry my hair with an ionic hair dryer but Sedu's ionizer is DRASTICLY different. I use #2 setting (hot) first to get rid of excess moisture and then finish with #1 (warm) while using a boars bristle brush. I used to spend a long time drying, only to end up with large & frizzy hair, and then spend even more time using a flat iron and my hair never even came near the smoothness & utter silkiness that using the Sedu Revolution has afforded me. I have not once used my flat iron since the first use of this ionic dream of a hair dryer. My boyfriend literally was amazed as well when he saw me after less than 10 minutes of use - and he couldn't stop touching my hair!<br />I've never written a review like this but I hope if that you are on the fence due to the price - give it a try and you will not be disappointed."	1/21/2014

I've burned out several blowdryers due to clogged air intake, but I know it won't happen with this one as the lint is so easy to remove.  The only reason I'm giving this blowdryer four stars instead of five is because it is not QUITE as powerful as others I've used, which adds a little extra time to my blowdrying, maybe a couple of minutes.

"When I plugged in this dryer and used it the first time, I was absolutely amazed with how quickly it dried my hair, how well it straightened my naturally wavy hair, and how much shinier and healthier it made my hair look when I was done too!<br /><br />It took me about 4 minutes to dry my hair with my Xtava hair dryer, which is amazing for me! My hair is super long and super thick and usually takes 7 minutes at the fastest, especially when my hair is still pretty wet because I pretty much just got out of the shower. I was absolutely stunned by the drying time. In fact, it dried my hair faster than my much more expensive dryer I've been using for the last few years.<br /><br />I used it on the highest heat setting and and speed setting. You can dry it slower if you like, but I read somewhere awhile back that it's better to dry on a higher speed and higher temp, and get the heat off your hair as quickly as possible, so thats just how I've always dried my hair. Plus I'm usually in a big hurry so this works best for me.<br /><br />Once dried, I then blasted my hair with the cool setting, which worked really great and really made my hair less frizzy and gave it instant shine and made it look healthier too!<br /><br />While using this dryer the last week, I have also noticed my hair has been much less frizzier too, especially for this time of year! It's so cold and dry here, my hair usually goes POOF! As soon as I walk out the door, but my hair has been surprisingly tame this week, I think in thanks to my new Xtava Blowdryer!<br /><br />I also love that this hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle so I can deliver lots of heat to one specific area. I didn't always dry my hair this way until recently, but I've found it really dries your hair so much faster!<br /><br />This hair dryer is also quite noticeably lightweight! I was surprised when I picked it up when I first opened the package. I love that you can hold it on your hair for several minutes and never get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!<br /><br />My only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that's just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can't sit still just doing my hair! Otherwise, it has perfect reach for standing in front of the mirror and bending over to blast underneath your hair!<br /><br />I'm completely obsessed with this blowdryer, especially since it will only cost you $29 on Amazon, and completely rivals the uber expensive hair dryers on the market! And actually in my opinion, it's better than my super expensive dryer, because it dries my hair in nearly HALF the time! Absolutely amazing!<br /><br />I highly recommend this dryer to everyone. Seriously ladies, stop wasting the big bucks on expensive hair dryers, this Xtava Rimini 1500W Iconic Hair Dryer will get the job done faster, and will leave your hair straighter, and feeling much healthier, and looking much shinier too! I'm completely impressed with this hair dryer and will be using it for many years to come!r get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!<br /><br />My only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that's just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can't sit still just doing my hair!

And actually in my opinion, it's better than my super expensive dryer, because it dries my hair in nearly HALF the time! Absolutely amazing!<br /><br />I highly recommend this dryer to everyone. Seriously ladies, stop wasting the big bucks on expensive hair dryers, this Xtava Rimini 1500W Iconic Hair Dryer will get the job done faster, and will leave your hair straighter, and feeling much healthier, and looking much shinier too! I'm completely impressed with this hair dryer and will be using it for many years to come!"	1/9/2015

I set my hair in medium sized rollers and I found that I couldn't fit my entire head under the dryer. AND it was incredibly loud. I must say that I like the fact that the dryer got hot enough to dry my hair (that could fit in), but not hot enough to cause damage. In order to get back of my hair some air time, I had to turn facing the dryer and tilt my head down, obviously that wasn't too comfortable. If I can get rid of this dryer I will, but if not I will live with it. Next time I will go for a hood dryer with a more circular design, instead of the cone style that this one has, Im sure that'll help me to get my whole head in."	1/31/2011

I have fairly thick hair that I keep mine cut short so if Pro-v was going to give my hair volume I would hardly notice. Overall I was pleased with the shampoo and it literally left my hair squeaky clean. I'm not sure if that's necessarily a good thing since according to my wife that squeak is caused when shampoo strips the oil from your hair. I needed to continue to use my Head and Shoulders occasionally because the Pro-v doesn't seem to help with dandruff. The Pro-v was fine but I didn't notice a huge difference with other shampoos.	8/5/2010

"This is a very sleek and stylish hair dryer. It looks very nice! It’s powerful at 2200 watts. This hair dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle but no diffuser. However, a previous diffuser that I owned fit on this just fine. It has a nice long cord too. The only thing is the cord is really thick so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way. I was very excited to get an opportunity to receive this for testing and inspection purposes. It works very well and dries my hair quickly. I like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do. This one comes in black and looks very stylish. The concentrator works well too but you do need to push hard to get it on the hair dryer. It has three temperatures, hot, warm, and cold (or room temperature but it always feels cold to me.) It also has two speeds, low and high. In addition, it comes with a cool shot button, which gives you a blast of cold air when you push the button. The button is easy to push but it's also black so it blends into the hair dryer. I would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color. Other than that though, I really like this hair dryer. It's powerful and efficient at drying my hair. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product."	3/1/2015

I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't experienced it myself, but I've been very pleased with the results.<br /><br />As mentioned elsewhere, the switch/button design makes it a little difficult to adjust the settings as you're drying.  But the chosen settings do stay in place once set, and the design of the sliding switches does make the handle easy and comfortable to grip.  So there is both good and bad points with this sliding switch design.<br /><br />Finally, the three heat and two speed settings give me more options than my last hair dryer did, which is very nice.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with this purchase.

How confusing!  I finally decided upon the Argan Heat because no one on Amazon rated it below 3 stars.  This was the first time I ever bought a hair dryer over $30.00.  Using the Argan Heat made me realize that the reason my hair was so dry, fragile and difficult to grow was because my cheap hair dryer was damaging my hair. Now my hair dries quickly, feels silky and looks healthy.  My complaints about this hair dryer are that the warm setting is barely luke warm,  the low-speed setting blows too hard, and the concentrator attachment is difficult to screw/push on (it does not slide on as the box says).  I am not bothered by the weight, and the predominant sound the dryer makes is a pleasant, quiet whoosh, but there is also an underlying straining motor sound that has me concerned.  I may end up exchanging this hair dryer before the return date expires in case there's a problem."	5/3/2014

"I bought this hair dryer when I decided to replace my still working, but not doing the best job, Conair. I am a sucker for anything different, and this fit the bill. I washed my hair right after I bought it so I could check it out. After using it all I could think of were these three words: No Me Gusta. I didn't even finish drying my hair with it, my Conair takes me 5 minutes tops to dry my thick, shoulder length hair. I was on 20 minutes with this one and I had had enough. Also, it kept sucking my hair into the vents which was rather painful. This hair dryer is severely lacking oomph. It takes me less time to dry my hair with my old conair and style separately then it would have taken me to style and dry with this thing.     I am returning it tomorrow and I'll buy a regular blow dryer.     Once again, NO ME GUSTA."	4/30/2011

You won't regret this purchase	"This is a GREAT dryer and my review will compare the Sedu Revolution 4000i with the Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000.<br /><br />When the Harry Josh 2000 dryer came out I was dying to buy it but just couldn't justify the price. I was in desperate need of a good dryer (since I straighten my hair almost every day).  After lots of research and reading reviews on every single dryer out there, I decided to go with the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i. Especially since it was chosen by Harry Josh himself as HIS FAVORITE DRYER (obviously before he developed his own dryer)…so I figured the Sedu was a great choice. I've loved this dryer since day 1. Love it. But…I still had my heart set on the Harry Josh dryer. I figured it would be even better than the Sedu and somehow cut my dry time to mere seconds :)<br />I finally justified the purchase of the Harry Josh by telling myself that my Sedu would be my travel / back up dryer. After all, everyone needs an emergency blow dryer!<br /><br />So the Harry Josh dryer arrives and I immediately notice it's the same exact body casing as the Sedu. Even the attachments are exact and fit on both dryers. EVERYTHING and I mean everything right down to the cord length, switches, markings and body size were exact. Even the motor sounds exactly the same when turned on. The only difference I can see is that one is mint green and one is black.<br />Now I admit, I don't know what kind of motor each one has, but it seemed strange to me that Harry's new $250-300 dryer appears to be the exact same machine as his once beloved &#34;favorite dryer.&#34; So I decided to perform my own dry test and see which one, if any, dried my hair faster and made it smoother.<br /><br />I tested for six total days. For three days I dried with the Sedu and for three days with the Harry Josh. I alternated days to account for weather, humidity in the air, more or less product applied, etc.<br /><br />On all six days I followed the same exact routine (water temp / shampoo / conditioner / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days. On average, using the Sedu, it took about 5:30 min to get my hair dry and approx 7 minutes to dry it with the Harry Josh.<br /><br />The Harry Josh DID make my hair a slightly smoother, but nothing really earth shattering.<br /><br />I decided to keep my Sedu and return the Harry Josh.<br /><br />Note: My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, curly, fine, and a little frizzy. It's also color treated.<br /><br />So all in all, I highly recommend the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i dryer. Even though it's expensive it's totally worth it if you straighten your hair a lot. I'm thrilled with mine.r / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days.

"Wow!  First and foremost, if you have long hair this is the Hair Dryer for you!  I have long hair and constantly fight with the air intake valve on my other hair dryers as they suck up my hair and it gets tangled up inside!  The Rimini by XTAVA  has mesh like metal over the air intake valve and cannot suck my hair into it. Secondly, it is powerful which is probably why it says professional in the name and oh SO quiet compared to all the other hair dryers I have used.  Third, it is light and the handle makes it so easy to use and to reach the different control buttons while you are still drying.  Love that it has a cold shot button to help &#34;set&#34; my hair.  It comes with a control nozzle that fits very well and is easy to get off and on to precisely aim the air right where you want it.<br />All in all I will tell you this is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned and it is aesthetically pretty too!  I won't get into all the specs because you can read them above but it does have 3 heat settings and yes, I use them all during one drying and it has 2 speed settings plus the cold shot button.  It usually takes about 20 minutes to completely dry my hair and with this one it took about 12 minutes.

You can read the other reviews about how well it works.<br /><br />BUT -- the wire slowly starts to twist and it's not possible to fully untwist it.  It has to do with the rubber that covers the copper wire.  Well, this morning the wire completely disconnected from the hairdryer itself.  There was no smoke, fire, etc.  It just twisted off.  This is poor construction and something that you'd expect from a cheap product, not from something that's $100+.<br /><br />Giving it 2 stars because when it was working it was great, but a $100+ hair dryer should last longer than a year and a half.  $30 hair dryers may suck, but they are at least built to last longer than this one."	3/26/2014

"I have used Mentadent ever since it came on the market. I always liked the way it was packaged (in a pump, rather than a tube) and liked the flavor of the product. I always thought that it was doing a great job cleaning and protecting my teeth and eliminating tartar, and my feelings were validated when my dentist asked me How come you don't have any tartar this time?? (I had been using Mentadent for approx. 8 months at that point)  I told him what I was using and he just sort of nodded and said well, something is working!  At my next checkup it was the same story---little to no tartar! He could not believe it and remarked that it was also whitening my teeth---1 shade whiter in about a year of use! (Mentadent contains peroxide)  A couple of years ago I added a Sonicare toothbrush to my arsenal and since then my teeth have gotten 2 more shades whiter!  I could not be more pleased with Mentadent and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price!  I immediately signed up for automatic shipments of 6 refills at a time, as I am no longer able to find it in my local stores.  I have stocked up from Amazon (bought 18 refills in May 2011) and will continue to do so at every  opportunity as I dont' ever want to do with out my Mentadent.  :o)    UPDATE - MAY 2011: I am SO bummed--and actually a little angry--that Amazon has suddenly decided to drop the Subscribe & Save option on the Advanced Cleaning formula Mentadent that I had been buying from them for years. >:o(  They tried to be helpful and suggested that I replace this S&S item with an advanced whitening item of a similar price. This WILL NOT work for me as after 2 wks of use the advanced whitening makes my teeth very sensitive! Seriously, if they want to be helpful and show that they appreciate all the years that I have been a loyal customer of this and MANY other items from them they should reinstate the S&S option for the Advanced Cleaning formula that they still carry. >:o(    What's next? Suddenlythey won't even offer this formula of Mentadent at all? :o("	7/2/2011

I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it, and needed a hair dryer with a diffuser. After looking through reviews I decided to purchase this one over some cheaper models or buying the same Vidal Sassoon model I've owned for many years.<br />My first impression was that I was shocked by how heavy it was, because it's ceramic. It can be sort of awkward to use before you get used to it. Secondly, the difference between the &#34;warm&#34; to the &#34;hot&#34; setting is pretty big. The &#34;warm&#34; on mine has barely more heat than the &#34;cool&#34; setting and the &#34;hot&#34; setting is too hot to use for more than a minute or two. The &#34;hot&#34; also makes my hair super frizzy, but that's fixed by blasting it on the &#34;cool&#34; setting after the heat. But I do worry that it damages my hair. I would use the &#34;warm&#34; setting if it didn't take so long.<br />This hair dryer is kept at my boyfriend's and I only use it to dry the roots of my hair with the diffuser to give them lift, so it doesn't see much use. Because I don't use it often I can get over the negatives of the dryer and it is alright for me. If I had to use it every day or dried more than the roots of my hair I would return it."	11/29/2014

"I've had this hair dryer for at least 4 years, and although I did not purchase it from Amazon I am still reviewing the product itself.

Using an old toothbrush can help clean this off, 2) do NOT use the hottest setting.  As others have stated, it WILL fry your hair.

"I saw other reviews talk about it being super powerful.  I don't find that, but it's quite adequate.  It IS heavy and big, but I'm ok with it, and I'm tiny.  I don't see how a dryer can be not heavy if it has good vibration damping and noise muffling, which this does.  I love the low noise level, as it is right by my ear, I've had enough of the loud flimsy light dryers in the past.  The only annoying thing is the buttons on the handle.  I have to be very careful when I move it around my head, it's easy to touch the buttons and change the settings unintentionally.  Also the head is LONG; I have long hair too, and I'm a tiny person.

"I'm pretty lazy. I will avoid excess walking at most costs. My ass can prove it.<br />So, we needed a new hair dryer for the changing table (we dry off our baby after we use wet wipes on her butt, and after she gets a bath), and we had to have one that was fast and could have a &#34;just warm&#34; setting. This one is so good that I find myself walking from one end of the house to the other in the morning to dry my own hair at the changing table. Without a mirror, no less. It's that good. So I just need to get a second one now because I can't keep this extra activity up.<br />Oh, and it's loud (I don't know how they'd make one that isn't), but I love the 4 settings (cool slow, warm fast, hot slow, and hotter fast) and it dries my hair in half the time as my old crappy one does. Even though it has the same wattage.<br />I also like the fact that it's white. Even if the cord isn't (that's actually annoying to someone like me who bought a white hair dryer because there are only bright colors in the nursery.... and now I have an unsightly black cord sticking out like a sore thumb). I guess you can't have it all."	2/19/2013

I like the cool blower for finishing when the day is hot. I keep pressing the cool shot button accidentally, however, because it's so darn convenient. The cool shot button is exactly where my thumb naturally rests and I have to keep that in mind. The cord is shorter than I'd like, and a good bit shorter than my last dryer. The sliding controls aren't wonderful. The friction ridges are quite flat and the two slides mesh so well and are so narrow that my thumb can't tell them apart. I have to press those flat ridges so hard that it hurts my thumb, so I use my &#34;off&#34; hand to slide the controls. There's some kind of thin, plastic-like finish that's slowly peeling off, but that doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />My last dryer was a Black & Decker. It was very small and compact and did the job for many years, possibly as much as 20 years. I do still wish I could have replaced it with the same thing.<br /><br />All this sounds like complaining, I know, but they're trivial complaints (except the cord length). I've never had a diffuser attachment before but I found it worth learning to use. I used to dry and style my short, curly hair in about a minute on the hot setting, but now the diffuser and the warm setting do it just as fast and better. The Conair hot setting is pretty hot, so if you need that you'll be happy. Best of all is that, even in the winter, my hair never gets flyaway with static electricity.<br /><br />I've had this Conair less than a year, so I can't comment on its durability.<br /><br />BTW, I bought this upon the recommendation of Consumer Reports. They called it a good value and I certainly agree.<br /><br />I've had it almost 4 years now and it's still trouble-free."	6/17/2013

"I purchased this mini hairdryer because I travel a lot, and because I have a small bathroom and I don't like taking up a lot of precious counter space. Plus, is it just me, or have regular-sized hair dryers doubled in size over the past few years? They're huge and over-sized, in my opinion. I saw that this came with a travel bag (zebra-striped) as well as a diffuser and concentrator attachment. For the price (around $15), I thought this was a great deal. I was expecting to be let down by this little hair dryer, but I was pleasantly surprised with it! It works great, and I haven't had any problems with it. The only thing that would make this better would be if they could include a 'cool' setting, but for the price I paid, I'm not complaining.<br /><br />If you travel a lot or if you just don't want a huge hairdryer, this is a great hairdryer."	3/20/2013

"I have long wavy/curly hair and I've never owned a hair dryer. I always thought air drying was best for the health of my hair but lately my hair has gotten so gross and messy and frizzy that I almost considered giving myself a hair cut and just chopping off everything off a few times. I did start using a cleanser once a week and that helped somewhat but my hair was still just horrible. So instead of doing something drastic I decided to give blow drying a chance. I bought the Babyliss 3 in 1 diffuser with it so I've only ever used the two together. Before I get into the results, my first two thoughts when opening the box was that 1. The black is a beautiful deep matte color and the pink is a lot nicer on the product then in the picture and 2. It's a lot lighter than I expected. Everybody complained about how heavy it was. Again, I've never owned a hair dryer so maybe they're normally a lot lighter then this one. But from me, no complaints!<br /><br />And to the results... My hair is absolutely amazing now. Sometimes I'll just look at my hair in the mirror or even when a perfect curl falls on my shoulder and I'm just so happy. It's like it was styled and curled for hours to get it to look like that. It takes about 20 minutes to dry it completely and style it which sure beats the 4 hours it takes to air dry it. I put in some before products, lots of mousse and some gel and get to scrunching and by the end my hair is so full of volume and curls! And the best part is that my hair is still perfect for the next two days.

I received this package today and was really excited about it. When I opened the box I saw at least 4 small bugs crawling around in it. This was enough to make me immediately close the box and bring it outside my house. As for the product, it looks great and as pictured but I didn't get a chance to try it because I am sending it back to Amazon tomorrow. I don't believe that this pest issue would be from the product so I think it must have happened in the warehouse/packaging stage. I'm disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try this blowdryer but I will not be ordering another one for fear of the same thing happening again."	10/30/2014

If I rotate it up, the blow dryer is stopped by the wall holding the holder. There's absolutely no chance of using any other angle. I tried sticking it to the tile (like in the photo) on my vanity top for a lateral angle, but not even 1 little suction cup would do anything but slide all over.

I found it well balanced, not too heavy, not too loud, and it did dry my hair fast. The only thing I would have liked is a lower setting that doesn't blow quite so hard. I have very fine hair and even on low this dryer blows my hair all over the place. I'm not sure I would love it if I needed to use a dryer on a daily basis but for the occasional quick dry user it is fine. Another possible issue if you don't have very long arms you may find the nozzle too long with the directional attachment in place. It adds a lot of length to the end of the dryer bringing it too close to your hair which can do damage. It does have a cool setting which I did like, it takes longer to dry but it doesn't damage fine hair."	5/7/2009

I was very happy with the dryer, as it was powerful and offered a reasonable selection of temperatures.  I exercised proper care for the dryer and never abused it.  However, Friday morning I turned the dryer on, and since it is getting cold, I decided to use high heat instead of medium heat like I almost always choose.  After just a few moments there came a hot, nasty smelling smoke jetting out from behind the power switch.  I unplugged the dryer and have not plugged it back in since.<br /><br />I went to Target to find a replacement, and was disappointed.  None of them performed as well as this one.  But I'm afraid to buy another.  What has the world come to when you can't even buy a decent hair dryer for less than $75 unless you're willing to accept this kind of crappy workmanship?  I guess the solution is to buy them in quantity and treat them as disposable.<br /><br />If it didn't perform so well (when it wasn't producing smoke and fire) then I'd give it the minimum score... but since it really does work nice, I'll give it two stars.  Buy more than one, and don't let them run unattended."	10/26/2010

Mine are usually fairly cheap (under $25). That  being said, this is the best I have seen in it's price range. The attachments fit without being whipped across the room for no reason like my others and it dries hair twice as fast as my previous. I don't have as many split ends either. For durability it has held up fairly well being used at least once daily by a complete klutz who drops things. Never any damage, cracking, or peeling. It is also quite pretty! Some say it is heavy in the reviews. While I was used to a lighter one, I only noticed a weight difference the first few times before it seemed normal to me. The only issue I have had with it is that my long hair will sometimes get sucked in the back. I have learned to keep it held higher. And since it is slightly heavier than my last I guess I get a light work out while doing so, lol. Overall a very good hair dryer and I would recommend."	7/29/2013

I was sold on it way back in the beginning when I'd been using it a few months and some women commented across a room that my face glows! I knew it was the Healthy Skin lotion and have never parted ways with it since. I am 40 now and honestly get told a lot that I look to be in my mid-late 20's. A lot of that is staying out of the sun and this lotion. The ONLY complaint I have about it is the scent.

Looks expensive."	"This is a very nice, professional looking hairdryer. Nice color and the design is very sleek and sharp looking. Looks like it's worth a lot more than what it really cost. It comes in a nice box, so it's very suitable for gifting.The description says it's &#34;ultra lightweight&#34; but, for me, it felt like it weighed just as much as any other hairdryer. I like that it has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. I have very fine hair, so how much heat I use on my hair makes a big difference. The hottest setting does seem to get very hot, so be careful. Also with my fine hair, the higher settings had a tendency to tangle my fine hair, so I had to usually use the medium heat setting, which worked well. The hairdryer itself was not loud and dried my hair quickly. It has a long cord and comes with a concentrator nozzle which really help to reduce frizz. The concentrator nozzle is very easy to remove and put back on when needed. I also like that this hairdryer had a removable filter, it was easy to twist off for cleaning. Overall, it's powerful and does a nice job. I loved the look and it's easy to hold and use. Hoping it will last awhile.

"This is a fast, powerful hair dryer. I have medium length, medium thick hair and this little number works fast without over-drying. The problem? The plug is too loose in the socket. This is the same socket I've used for several different curling wands, straighteners, hair dryers, battery chargers and even Glad plug-ins over the last eight years. The plugs on all those items fit the outlet just fine. The plug on this dryer will fall right out of the socket six or seven times in the five or six minutes it takes to dry my hair. VERY frustrating! I usually sit a heavy book about 8 inches out on the cord to hold it steady then shove a vase against the plug to keep it in the socket. Of course, this leaves very little cord length for raising the dryer up to my head since the cord is already a bit short."	4/11/2013

It's easy to install, and handy as all get out. However, almost on its one-year birthday, the low setting stopped working, and within minutes it went from blowing on high regardless of the setting to becoming a fire hazard. The handgrip started heating up as I held it, and when I tried to turn it off, the switch was frozen completely and it continued to overheat even more. Since it had taken on a life of its own, I had to unplug the unit and un-install the whole thing. This is a great concept for a hairdryer--it can't be beaten for convenience while still being stowed out of the way when not in use. Granted, an appliance that retails for less than $30 can be expected to not last forever, but I've owned hand-held hairdryers that wouldn't quit for years and years. I'm disappointed--my first thought was to purchase another just like it, but since this appears to be a problem for others as well, I'll look for another solution."	5/14/2013

"I don't put a lot of fuss into my hair, but recently we moved to a much different climate (hot and humid). Since I didn't want to wait all day for my hair to mostly dry, I wanted to pick up a cheap hair dryer. For the price, this one is fantastic. The hot setting is a bit hot (but aren't they all?) but the cool setting is really strong, so I use that most often. For all the power it puts out, the dryer is small too, which is great.<br />If I had to make a complaint, it would be that the cord could be longer, and it isn't coiled so it doesn't stretch at all."	4/1/2014

The main reason that I purchased this dryer was its price, practicality and its brand. Andis is one of the leaders in professional clippers in the hair industry, so I figured that I would give this dryer a shot. I have fine/normal curly just to about the ears, and this dryer gets it QUITE straight.I must admit that the &#34;high velocity&#34; air speed is not there, however, The HEAT is REALLY intense. As a professional, if I had to compare this to a standard salon dryer, performance wise, I would say that it acts a lot like the original Chi dryers, low speed, INTENSE heat, with ionic coating to break water molecules up faster. Now, that being said, if someone wants a dryer that really BLOWS the water out of the hair, I would recommend, concerning affordability and professional performance, the Babyliss 2800,  not that weighty and TRULY cuts drying time, in half, has a 3 year warranty AND Amazon sells it for half the retail price .<br /><br />This little Andis dryer works great for hair shorter than top of the shoulders, if you have really thick/curly or long hair, I would recommend use a T parting in your hair (draw a straight line with a wide toothed comb from the center of your eyebrows, to the back of your neck and comb each section down, from the very top of your head, draw a line from ear to ear to make a lower case 't' on your head) and do your hair in quadrants, (clipping them with butterfly clamps helps to keep other sections out of your way) 3-5 min extra prep time, but works WONDERS for straightening effectively, and saves you time in the end.<br /><br />This dryer does exactly what it says, it 'styles' hair, quite nicely might I add.The attachments are better than other vertical dryers that I have owned.The brush attachment is boar bristle, which allows one to naturally distribute oil through the hair, which is essential to a less frizzy and smoother blow dry. For those who have coarse, thick,tightly curled, or all of the above, use the comb attachment that best suits you, and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go, this will 'mold' your hair. Air cool the section that you are working on,The cool shot button on ANY dryer is almost useless, takes too long to cool, by the time it does, the section that you are working on is practically almost ready and is 'set'.<br />Overall, this is a four star dryer, it comes with a FIVE year warranty, it's very hot, and it is great for people (like me) who suffer from carp-tunnel and arthritis in their hands. At under twenty dollars, this is a great deal, it is nearly impossible to find one locally at that price, especially with a professional brand backing it. Thanks again Amazon, I find SO much great stuff here!r all of the above, use the comb attachment that best suits you, and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go, this will 'mold' your hair.

After that it would take me another 15 min to straighten and smooth it to get frizz out. This dryer dries my hair STRAIGHT without having to section it off. I don't even have to flat iron it afterwards!!!  It is smooth, straight, and frizz-less in under 10 min!  Amazing!  Will NEVER buy any other dryer!!"	2/10/2015

I admit that I love to buy beauty products, but especially hair products. My hair is colored/highlighted, fairly straight, but not thin. Lately I keep buying products to take the dry frizz that seems to appear on the ends of my hair. Little did I know that using the Conair Tourmaline Hair Dryer would solve that problem immediately. The dryer has settings for the usual hot/cold/warm settings and high/medium/low...but it's nice to have the controls slide on either side of the device. It's a powerful 1875 watts that dries my hair faster with ions and gives it body plus takes away the dry ends almost 100%. My co-workers noticed my hair looking better too. Ironically, I don't always use a blow dryer because I want healthy hair, but this dryer seems to make my hair look better. For the price and function, I recommended this dryer."	6/19/2015

I am right handed, andthe way I hold this dryer, allows me to  I sometimes accidently hit the off button as I am drying my hair. It is not a deal breaker, but a bit annoying. Nice wattage and fast drying. I would purchase it again, although maybe their newer models have the button relocated. Price of the item was reasonable as was the shipping cost.

US	43966088	REKOCDKRELLWP	B00JH2C3DE	768062995	panasonic eh-na65-k hair dryer	Beauty	5	36	42	N	N	Great Hair Dryer!  Well Worth the Money!!!	"I have long hair, that is about half way down my back.  I've never been a huge fan of blow dryers and used to just let my hair air dry.  Lately my hair is wavier than it used to be if I air dry it, so it doesn't look as nice, and I've started blowing it dry most times I wash it.  Previously, I've only purchased a couple of hair dryers, and I don't think I spent much money on them.  I have been dealing with some flyaways lately too so when my previous blow dryer quit on me, I did a little research before buying a new one.  I never anticipated spending this much money on a blow dryer.  I mean, aren't they all the same?  I soon learned that the answer is NO.<br /><br />This is still a fairly new product, so there were not a lot of reviews to go by.  I did research on what to look for in a hair dryer.  It was pretty easy to decide that negative ions are a good thing when buying a hair dryer.  Tourmaline? Ceramic? Well, ok, but what about nanoe?  It seems that Panasonic is the only one using this technology right now.  Infuses 1000x more moisture into hair than typical ion hair dryers?  I was definitely skeptical when I read that.<br /><br />I knew that I definitely wanted separate controls for speed and heat, and the Panasonic EH-NA65-K has that.  I was also hoping to find a hair dryer that came with a couple of attachments.  The nozzle for my last hair dryer would come off sometime when I was using the hair dryer because it just slipped over the end of the dryer.  The Panasonic comes with 3 different attachments that snap into place and can be turned to whatever orientation you are looking for.  They are nice attachments!<br /><br />As I said before, there were only a few reviews out there, but what was there was nothing but great reviews.  What the heck, I decided to give it a try and I must say that I'm very pleased.  This hair dryer is quite a bit quieter than my previous one.  I also really noticed how much I am used to the quietness of this the last time I got a hair cut and the salon used a regular dryer to dry my hair.  It was way louder.  This also dries my hair much quicker, which is really nice.  With the amount of hair I have, it takes a while to dry.  Most of the time I am using the quick dry nozzle.  I also found that I didn't need to brush my hair while using this hair dryer.  I just dry it free style and my hair looks good and straight when I'm done.  As for the flyaways, it didn't completely solve that problem, but it does seem to make that better too.<br /><br />After using this hair dryer the first time, I thought my hair looked a little darker than normal, and figured that my mind must just be playing tricks on me since I know this is supposed to infuse moisture in my hair.  The next day, one of my coworkers asked me if I did something different to my hair.  I asked why they asked and they said my hair looked a little different color than normal.  I have natural red hair and have never dyed my hair before.  I couldn't believe it!  I didn't tell anyone that i was getting a new hair dryer.  That told me that what I noticed must have been true.<br /><br />To summarize, I am very happy with my new hair dryer.  It hurt to spend this much money at first, but now I think it was well worth the cost.  Now I just wish that Panasonic would come out with a travel size nanoe hair dryer.  This hair dryer is a little larger than a regular one, due to the nanoe port on the top.  Between that and just the weight of it being a full size hair dryer, I don't really want to take it with me when I travel.  I travel for business about once a month a really miss this hair dryer when I'm gone.<br /><br />Panasonic, please make a Travel Nanoe Hair Dryer!"	9/19/2014

The Andis is more feature packed (see my separate review). The Conair is a bit quieter than most hair dryers I've owned including the Andis model. I used a db digital sound meter to measure the difference, the Conair was only 76db vs. 83db from the Andis model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers. The Conair is packed with 1875 watts which is more than enough to dry long thick hair. There are 2 heat settings (low & high) and a cool setting. The cool setting is the same temperature as when using the cool shot button (no heat at all). The air intake on the back is a 1-3/4 inch round opening covered by a removable lint screen. The opening is a bit small when compared to the Andis model which is larger at 2-3/8 inches and has side air intakes as well. This begs the question of reliability of the Conair because overheating of the motor is a prone problem of all hair dryers and with a small air intake opening on the Conair model, this could cause more heat build up of the motor. Only time will tell. The unit has 2 blower speeds, although I wish it had 3 for more versatility. The velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models. Air temperature at maximum is 162 degrees on the Conair and 198 degrees on the Andis using a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached, all be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory. The retractable cord is nice and measures 5 feet + 3 inches with 5-1/2 inches that does not retract into the handle. The retracter is a bit stronger than the Andis model but it will still require you to help feed the cord all the way to its end. The dryer does come with a 3 year warranty but the Andis model comes with a generous 5 year warranty. Both the Conair and the Andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same.  My favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design & feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design & feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars."	4/25/2014

"I considered shelling out some serious cash to buy a high end blow-dryer but then I realized that's stupid...and I'm cheap, so I bought this instead and I honestly could not be happier!  I have long hair (like to the middle of my back) and it's pretty thick and this dryer dries my hair in under 10 minutes.  My last dryer took FOR.EV.ER so to avoid getting stared down by my husband and watching the hate build in his eyes because I was taking so long to get ready and thus withholding whatever meal we are trying to go eat from him, I would just not bother drying and curling my hair and instead would just rock my natural fro but with this new dryer I can do my hair and still get out of the house quickly (relatively, anyway).<br /><br />I recommend this dryer highly!

So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.<br /><br />This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don't have curly hair so I didn't bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it's a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).<br /><br />I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed and pleased. I wish that the diffuser hadn't been included because I have no need for it and the space it takes up BUT I know that those with curly hair may appreciate it.<br /><br />UPDATE 09/18/16: While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more. The Remington's Cool Burst is far too easily activated when I am drying my hair, a problem I don't have with the Bio Ionic. Therefore, I am taking away 1-star to show this.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*y: *C.S. Light*"	8/25/2015

It is supposed to dry hair quickly and with minimal frizz and damage.  I found the drying time to be the same if not slower than my Conair 1875 blow dryer.  The rocker buttons are in an awkward thumb position and get in the way of a smooth grip on the handle.  Top it off with a very bulky and weighted feel and you have a dryer that is not suitable for our preference.	8/4/2015

"I highly recommend this dryer if you have thick or coarse hair that needs to be smoothed or straightened. If you are the type of person who just flips the hair around and smooths with fingers, this might be too much dryer for you, but I have no experience with that kind of hair. This is my first professional hair dryer, and I couldn't be happier. I have medium coarse hair (mixed race, ringlets, coarse but not kinky. 3b maybe?) that is currently just below chin length. I'm super-skeptical about product claims, so I did a lot of research. I read an article about a comparison of several models that convinced me of the effectiveness of titanium, and I knew I wanted 2000 watts just cause I wanted as much power as possible. There aren't too many dryers with those 2 features, so after reading the positive reviews, I decided on this model. From the first time I used it, I was very pleased. My hair was definitely softer and smoother. I never believed a hairdryer could make your hair softer, but this one definitely did. I can also dry my hair much more quickly, but I think that is because with this hair dryer, I am actually able to dry my hair like the hairdresser does (in big sections, using the curve of my head to smooth it out.) Previously, I always had to dry my hair in 1-2inch sections wrapping around and pulling with a round brush, which takes FOREVER. If I dry my hair that way with this dryer, it still takes about as long, but I don't really get much better results so I don't bother. CONS: 1. I still have to use a flat iron to smooth my ends. For the life of me, I can't get smooth ends with a hair dryer. I was really hoping this dryer would solve that for me, but instead it has convinced me that it is my technique, not the dryer. 2. It really does get HOT. I have to use medium heat around the edges of my hairline, and that can still be a little intense. If you have a sensitive scalp, this might be too much dryer for you. 3. The nozzles seem kinda cheap. My last hair dryer had  nozzles that snapped on, which made it easier to rotate and change the angle. These nozzles just fit snugly over the barrel and often come off when I try to rotate them. I can't speak to some of the other complaints about this dryer like weight and noise. I wouldn't call this dryer light or quiet, but it doesn't seem particularly loud or heavy to me. Personally, I wouldn't want to give up the performance of this dryer for those features.<br /><br />Hope this review helps, and happy styling everyone!"	10/29/2013

What I love about this dryer is that I no longer have to go clear across to another part of our home to dry my hair in the morning when my family is still asleep.  I can simply close my bedroom door and people in the other bedrooms aren't disturbed by the sound of my dryer.  This is a huge plus for us.  This dryer dries fast and makes my hair looks voluminous.

I'm hoping that it will give me the same great service.  The unit is larger than my original more compact version, but it does work well.  the reason that i'm giving this product a 3 is because it's more cumbersome, the slide switch on the handle is difficult to operate, (it doesn't slide easily) and there is a very bright night light built into it which I was aware of, but was surprised by the level of brightness it emits. It's too bright since my bathroom is part of the master suite without a door on it. I had to put duct tape over the light to try to block it out. This dimmed it about 50%. Obviously I'd much rather not have the light, or at least have an option to turn it off."	3/11/2013

This thing is great!<br /><br />No, it's not as powerful or capable as a &#34;full-sized&#34; dryer.  But, what do you expect from something that literally fits in the palm of your hand?  I, myself, expect a lot less than this dryer delivers.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of travel hair dryers, this one locates the fan at the back of the barrel and has some barrel length to it.  This lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every-which-way mess of air that most travel dryers produce.  It's not as directional as a full-sized dryer with a longer barrel, but it's better than most travel dryers.<br /><br />One reviewer reported that the controls are not labeled.  This is not true on the dryer I received.  The Low/Off/High switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked.<br /><br />Several reviewers have complained of it making a very high-pitched motor noise, getting very hot, smelling bad, and then dying.  The unit is shipped set for 125V (USA) power.  While it is true that many modern electronic devices have &#34;auto-ranging&#34; or &#34;universal&#34; AC inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere, this little hairdryer isn't one of them.  If you plug this dryer into 250V (European) power without manually changing the voltage selector switch to the 250V setting, the dryer will quickly fail exactly as described.  And that will be your fault, misuse, and not cause for a poor review.<br /><br />Mine has worked fine.  It drys my hair almost as fast as my &#34;professional&#34; dryer at home.  Its size, weight, and performance make this an easy choice for travel."	1/6/2015

"Admittedly, I don't have a ton of hair, and while this is a really nice blow dryer, if you're a guy with short hair, it's pretty extravagant.<br /><br />My wife and daughter, on the other hand, noticed a huge difference. My daughter isn't a huge fan of getting her hair dryed, and happily, this dryer reduces the torture time exponentially. I want to say the difference is in the diffuser, but there's more going on here. It isn't quite &#34;magical&#34;, but it's close.<br /><br />The &#34;magical&#34; part is probably with my wife's naturally curly hair. During the winter months, there's been some investment in products that control frizz, and I've been able to casually tell a difference between products. With this hair dryer, though, you'd swear some really expensive salon-grade stuff was used. The results are pretty surprising, and seem to last. I'd almost go as far as saying that this could save money, by reducing (or eliminating) the need for control products.<br /><br />At first, I was positive there was no way this hair dryer would be worth the money, but seeing how well it works with everyone in the family, I'd totally recommend it to anyone with curly hair, or who can't tolerate much time under the dryer."	11/25/2014

I was in a super big hurry and tried this out before reading the directions and without my bathroom mirror.  Immediately got my hair stuck in the intake and had to turn it off and attempt to use it later.   Next time I tried it I made sure to read the directions thoroughly and use the mirror to get used to the air intake in the back.  My previous blow dryers have intakes on the sides. This in take is larger for more air flow but you have to get used to keeping it further away as it will suck in hair as well as air.  The cover does come off easily for the in take so you can clean it out.  I love that it's intended to last 4 years!  One thing I did notice is that you aren't supposed to store it in a damp area so I keep it in my bedroom and just take it into the bathroom as needed.  The intake has a wire mesh screen  that could possibly rust so I appreciate this extra advice.  It does seem to make your hair nice and silky.  Update: died and the customer service was impeccable!

The problem is that this hairdryer has too much power on the low speed for a polished set and style.<br /><br />I wanted a hairdryer that would complete the first 50% of hair drying quickly, but then allow me to use a lower speed with my round brush to get a smooth finish. This dryer just has too much power going to it at the low speed setting, which means I get lots of flyaways. If you always flat iron or curl after drying, or if you don't care about style and just want to get your hair dry fast, or (maybe) if you have really thick strands, this could be a great dryer. With my medium-fine hair, I just can't get that polished set that I'm looking for. My hair does feel nice after I dry it, and if I'm planning to curl or flat iron after drying then I really appreciate how fast I can get my hair dry. However, I don't like that I MUST flat iron or curl my hair to get it to look finished. If this dryer had a third, lower speed setting, or if the low speed setting had 30% less power, this would be a GREAT hairdryer. As it is, I break out my old Vidal Sassoon 1875 to finish the style (I got the Remington when my Vidal Sassoon stopped working on &#34;high&#34; and would only work on &#34;low&#34;)."	2/10/2014

It was fantastic and worked as well as it did the day I bought it, until its coil lit up and a curl of smoke came out the blower. Alas, it was a sad day. I specifically bought this one based on the performance of the other, and it's not lived up to par, by a long shot.<br /><br />I bought this dryer 6 months ago and the retractable cord already doesn't work. That's the WHOLE reason I wanted this model. This one is heavier, hotter, and the cool shot is really just warm. Not to mention, it's hot pink.<br /><br />In all, I'm very disappointed with this dryer, and will look for another retractable one next time. I don't recommend getting this one, if that is the feature luring you.<br /><br />--UPDATE - Sept 2014<br />This hairdryer totally died a month ago. I'd had it 18 whole months, and it completely quit working. No fireworks, no warning, just plugged it in, and nothing. I tried several outlets throughout the house, and it would. not. work.<br /><br />I contacted Conair, and based on its model number, which indicated it was well within warranty, they would replace it for free, sort of. I had to pay $15 in shipping to return it to them. I think that's totally bogus, given that the unit shouldn't have had ANY problems in that timeframe. Hopeful, I sent it along. In about three weeks, they sent me another dryer--same model.<br /><br />Having used the only other dated dryer I had in the house during that three weeks, I can firmly attest that all dryers are not created equally. I recall now why I I loved the predecessor of this dryer, and this one, before it became problematic. It's quieter, the temperature is more controllable, it's well-vented and easily cleaned. Also, the refinement attachments actually fit the former model, snugly. They fall off this one--the one from the deceased predecessor, and the one that came with this replacement. It's virtually no use to me without the attachments.<br /><br />But honestly, I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last. That it works well is only part of what makes a product great. Longevity is part of the equation, as well.I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last.

Until certain steps are taken, the hair dryer won't work.  Don't try to figure it out on your own, just read the instructions that come in the box.  Once you've followed them, you'll be able to turn on your appliance.  It isn't necessary to do this EVERY time, just the first time, and I'm glad to have the extra safety feature."	10/16/2014

I have never been so disappointed in a salon quality hair dryer.  I am a blow-dry addict who watches my stylist closely when he blows my hair dry.  I am very good at getting a salon quality blow-out at home.  I used this product for 4 months, and it is sitting in the back of a drawer now.  If I wasn't so busy, I would send it back and demand a full refund.  I feel like I was duped.  The strength of the dryer is poor, which results in dry fly-aways.  It also does not get hot enough, so after you have spent 30 minutes blowing your hair dry, it looks like it is still damp and has been blown out with a super market dryer.  I have used the babyliss and solano hair dryers in the past, and am going back to them.  Don't fall for the hype - this company may have a great publicist, but the product falls short."	10/13/2009

I need a hairdryer to meet my needs: dry without loss of volume & decrease amount/use of root/shine styling products. Very surprised at how gentle the air flow comes out & how fast my hair dries.  I assume it's based on the barrel shape of the Onei dryer vs a more cylindrical barrel like some dryers. The packaging of the dryer far exceeded my expectations. The quality of the Onei feels/looks better than the sedu I purchased months ago. So far very surprised & looking to see if this will outlast my last dryer a wigo(5yrs).

"I was in the market for a diffuser, and I never bought one before... I will say this is the first and last diffuser I will ever buy. I'll stick with a regular hair dryer with a diffuser on the end.<br /><br />The heat in this isn't as hot as I would like it to be, compared to my normal hair dryer that gets really hot. I had to diffuse my hair on low, and this wasn't hot enough. Also, the low power was too low and the high power was too high. I also did not like how the air circulated in circles compared to the air coming out of a regular hair dryer in a straight motion. The circular motion blew all of my curls out (think if it like a fan you use to cool your house), and I don't have that happen on my regular blow dryer. I will say, that my natural curls are not very tight, and my goal when diffusing my hair is to help maintain my curls with a low heat... This did not cut it at all.. Not hot enough, and the way that the air circulated blew my curls out. I'm not sure if it is just this product or if it includes other diffusers like this as well... but I am sticking to my normal hair dryer with diffuser attachment!"	2/20/2015

My 3 year old Conair dryer broke last week so I did my research and saw the great review on this product and they were right, it's great!    The dryer is a bit heavier than the old one, but after a few minutes you realize the heaviness relates to the quality. It almost gives it a little bit of leverage when you use it.     The airflow is salon quality. My hair dried faster, looked shinier and felt extremely soft. It doesn't feel over dried or brittle as it usually did with my old dryer. I dried my hair no more than once a week for that reason, but I can't wait to use it every time, if I keep getting these results.    The color is pretty cool and the retractable cord is a BIG plus, no more tangles and messy cords taking up my bathroom space (now if only they could do that with my curling iron ;)    Over all I highly recommend this dryer, you can;t beat the quality and the price."	6/17/2009

They send a piece of paper with the dryer that says they'll give you a two year warrantee if you leave a 5 star review. Complete extortion. I can't believe Amazon works with these guys.

Secondly, I have used the same Revlon Ionic $15-20 blowdryer since I was about 16years old and never had any problems with it. I always repurchased the same one maybe once every 6years or so.<br /> My hair is naturally curly but its slowly lost most of its curl through the years and been left with a good amount of volume and wave. My hair had always gotten pretty frizzy when I blew it dry but I just figured that was part of the drying process. One day while at work I was looking at a T3 and discussing how my hair frizzes, i was told that with the new hair dryers and such that this isnt what should be happening and that i should get a new high end hair dryer. I researched many of the new T3 and the Drybar products only to be pretty disappointed considering the price. I actually bought a T3 and had problems with the end staying on it and the location of the switch and my hand. I had found the Elchim but was skeptical of it bc of the name in general. I wasnt a big name brand and no one i talk to had ever heard of it. After ONE use I could tell a huge difference. It doesnt dry my hair any faster though. I dont have any frizz and it is smoother, smells better, not to hot to touch, and a lot more shine! I really do recommend this to any woman (or man) who is considering buying a new expensive blowdryer and cant make up their mind...go with this one first!"	3/19/2014

"I researched a lot of hair dryers before finally deciding on this one. My priorities for a dryer is to not be too loud, and to dry my hair fast. I have thick long hair, and it can take 10-15 mins to get my hair completely dried. My old Conair dryer was working ok, but it was very loud and was taking a lot time to dry. Aesthetically, this dryer is very cute. It is quite large, but I love the texture and the pink accents. Some people had said it was a bit heavy, it is heavier than my Conair, but not too much where I feel like I have trouble holding it. It comes with 2 attachments, a diffuser and a concentrated air nozzle. I use the concentrated air nozzle every day. It is easy to attach and easy to come off. The best thing about this dryer is that it is not very loud at all! And yes, it does dry my hair a LOT quicker. With the help of the concentrated nozzle and a round brush, I can get my hair dry within 5-10 minutes. This is a huge improvement. It comes in 3 settings with 3 levels of heat, as well as a cold air button. The back of the dryer is easy to twist off for you to clean. Overall, I am very pleased with this dryer. Remington also has a 4 year warranty, which is very comforting."	9/18/2013

All controls are arranged conveniently so you don't mistakenly flip the wrong switch while using.  Dries my color treated fine shoulder length hair with little or no frizz and have actually cut back by at least half, the use of anti-frizz and shine boosting products so think of the $ savings there.

One thing though, it is so strong you need to make sure to not burn your hair by leaving it on one strand for too long! It's not like a conventional dryer, it will cut your drying time, so use it with that knowledge. If I didn't love my current dryer I'd definitely buy this one when/if it dies."	5/18/2013

I bought this for drying my Miniature Schnauzer furnishings at home and at shows. I picked this one because it has air coming in from both sides for maximum air flow. It works great. I've had it for nearly 2 years and use it often as I also groom for a few other owners. It still looks like new and all the switches work just like day one. I will buy again if this one ever goes out. I will also buy another one if my personal hair dryer (different brand) ever goes out. I've had it for nearly 20 years. LOL	7/7/2015

They take forever if you just want to blow your long hair dry.  This is that same model as my last one, only with half-again more power.

"My previous Vagabond, which I loved and traveled with for many years, finally kicked the bucket and I replaced it today with the current model.

I couldn't believe it and got the old one out of the trash to compare side by side. Shorter. By a lot.

"Absolute bargain of the century! My wife had two Chi's break in the course of around five years.

They could double the price and it would still be a steal. VERY well done. I like it so much, we are buying a second to stick on the shelf if the first ever gives up the ghost."	5/21/2015

The 'high' temperature is extremely hot, which dries my hair very quickly, but I'm not convinced it helps my hair look healthy, as my ends have started to look like straw since I started using this hair dryer.

The thing that first drew me to this hairdryer?  The color.  It's a bright, shiny, fushia color.  The make is very sleek and stylish.  Infiniti, by Conair, is light and easy to handle, even when you're using a brush with your other hand!  The best part of this hairdryer is, by far, the retractable cord, which makes it very easy to store.  The filter is removable, making the life of your hairdryer longer!<br /><br />Your hairdryer comes with a concentrator to help straighten your wavy or curly hair and a diffuser to give it body and life.  It also is equipped with Tourmaline Ceramic technology which, according to the box, generates ions that work hair molecules to help dry them inside and out... Ions smooth the cuticle layer... creating a silky, shiny look.<br /><br />I found the Infiniti to be a very usable hairdryer.  With heat options 'hot', 'warm', and 'cool', and power levels 'high' and 'low', there are plenty of way to dry and style your hair.  'Hot' never got too hot and 'warm' was perfect for my use.  Some hairdryers take a long time to cool down afterwards, but I am happy to report that the Infiniti cooled off quite quickly.  The retractable cord is also very handy.  One quick word of warning about the cord, it retracts VERY fast.  Be careful of fingers or retract it little by little and not all at once.<br /><br />From my experience, my hair did look straighter and more silky than usual, which might be due to the 'Tourmaline Ceramic technology'.  As mentioned before, I really do like this hairdryer."	9/22/2009

Just be sure to read the instructions... the first time I used the blowdryer it set my smoke alarm off because of the manufacturing residue in the blowdryer.  No real need to worry because there was a warning in the manual.  It was just inconvenient... had to open all the windows and turn off the dryer to get the smoke detector to go off.  There is an odd smell the first time you use the dryer but again, this was all described in the owner's manual.    Other than that, I've had compliments that my hair looks smoother.

I need a decent dryer to handle my long hair. Hotel dryers are always pretty cheap, and my old mini travel was useless. T3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size. You still get fairly fast dry times, softer hair, no frizz, and more volume. The only difference between the Travel and Full size is that the Travel drying times are a bit longer. It also comes with a little travel pouch, as an added bonus.<br /><br />You can certainly get away with buying the travel dryer for home use to save money over the regular one (which normally runs $200, and you really have to wait out the sales). It works better than a typical semi-professional dryer in the same price range (works better than my old Tool Science dryer, which was about $60).<br /><br />My favorite thing about the T3s is that they can actually handle restyling my hair when it's already dry (none of my old dryers could ever do this; I had to spray water in my hair and re-dry).<br /><br />Another review mentioned the drier did not have a serial number on the nozzle. This was not my experience. My dryer had the sticker with the serial number under the nozzle (look for a clear label that says DANGER). I highly recommend registering your product on the T3 website. I had problem with my full size dryer (not this travel size one), and the T3 Co, honored their warranty and fixed it."	4/2/2013

The dryer is pretty quiet and powerful, which is nice.<br /><br />One of the things I would change is the location of the buttons. I never fail to change the speed or heat when I'm using it.

"I have spent the past few months researching several different hair dryers and finally decided on this one. I'm so glad I did! I have super thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair and have been using a cheap drugstore dryer for the past several years. I'm not sure why I never realized that a good hair dryer could make such a difference, but I really wish I had figured it out sooner! I learned this lesson a few years ago when it comes to hair straighteners; I have the T3 Mane Tamer that I absolutely adore. So, I started there. T3 has a few different dryers, all with positive ratings, and all VERY expensive. I wasn't convinced that it would be worth it to spend that much. I read through tons of reviews for this Onei hair dryer and was happy with the positive reviews and the price. It arrived quickly and I couldn't wait to get it out of the box and use it! Normally, I spend a good half hour to 45 mins just getting my hair dry--not blowing it out, not using any brushes or styling tools/techniques, just getting it dry so that I can use my flat iron. The result (before flat ironing) is what I like to call my &#34;white girl afro&#34;--it is big, it is fluffy and it is crazy!<br />After reading some reviews and Q&As, I switched on the negative ion button, got my round brush and went to town. I could not believe how smooth my hair got just from blowing it dry. My technique was sadly out of practice and I did end up using my flat iron on a few spots, but I think that was entirely user error and expect it to get better with a little practice. I really believe that, once I get used to blowing my hair out again, I will be able to dry and style my hair with no flat iron required!!<br />My hair was so smooth and VERY shiny in the end, I was so happy with it. The dryer itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold and use and I love all the options it has with heat/cool, fan speed, etc. The buttons are perfectly located for my taste, not in the way at all and no risk of accidentallypushing buttons while using. I also love that there is both a cool shot (if you just need a quick blast of cool air) and a cool temperature setting (for when you want cool air for an extended period of time). I was also really impressed with how quiet this dryer is. When I first turned it on, it actually made me a little nervous because it was so quiet and I was afraid it wouldn't be very powerful, but that is definitely not the case--plenty of power without all the noise.<br />I am very, very happy with this hair dryer and would absolutely recommend it."	1/8/2014

It has a lot of power and my hair was completely dry in about 10 mins +/-. Considering how much hair I have this is FAST. The dryer itself is not too heavy and is quieter than most models. My hair was so soft, straight and shiny after using this hair dryer I must say I am instantly in love."	10/24/2012

'that sticky dryer whatchamacallit thingy'. :) mahalo (thank you) for reading my post. wishing you and those you love a very Merry Christmas and a Happy Always!!  Aloha & God Bless you.	12/19/2013

That bag fits easily in any suitcase or briefcase (or purse if you carry one).  The portability of this styler should not fool you as you have a full 1875 watts.

I knew when I bought it that it wasn't silent.<br /><br />It works great - warms up fast and the attachment it comes with helps me direct the air, so I'm not putting air where I don't want it and making my hair poofy.  I like that it has separate switches for temp and how fast the air is coming out.  The controls are side -by- side on the handle.  On the handle there is the option for warm and hot, and the one next to it has low and high.  There is a cool button on the back up by the mesh (when pressing this, it takes about 2 seconds for it to blow cool) - and on the side of the barrel there is the option for turbo on and turbo off - this gives 4 speeds of air flow.<br /><br />Just make sure the handle is all the way up, otherwise it will start to fold down on you. It does sort of catch in two places, so it won't close on your hand - there is also an inch and a half/two inch gap, so it's impossible to hurt your hand. I use it on my hair and also on beeswax sheets for rolling candles.  Works really well :)"	3/16/2013

True Story....I have spent approximately $500-$700 on different hair and blow dryers. I have all from the cheap ones to the expensive ones and this is by far the best damn blow/hair dryer I've owned. I am a black woman with natural 4c hair that means thick and coarse and typically when blow drying my hair it feels crunchy but this dryer did not make my hair feel like that. Of course I used the LOC method with Alikay Naturals products before blow drying my hair and it turned out straight like I needed it to be. I'm super happy and satisfied. Also I used the hair pick yo blow dry my hair and it did not pop off nor did I break the teeth in the pick. Dynamite!  If it pick does pop off just use heat resistant double side tape to keep it on.	3/28/2015

I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  Well, the retracting mechanism worked perfectly once or twice.  After that, it would take 2-3 tries to get it to retract the cord all the way.  Usually, it would stop roughly mid-way.  After a couple months of that silliness, it now won't retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  This hair dryer was barely used at all before this bad behavior started.<br /><br />Do you remember those terrible roller window shades we had back in the 70's?  You know the ones.. they were ugly white and every time you tried to make the shade go up all the way, you'd struggle?  You'd pull it a tiny bit and hope it'd release the mechanism and pull up, but instead, it'd pull out a little more each time until finally you had that sucker pulled all the way down to the floor?  Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair dryer!<br /><br />Other observations:<br />- The release button is in an awkward position, so even when this was working, it was an awkward 2-handed affair.<br />- The noise seems a little less than a typical hair dryer.  But then again, the airflow seems a little less too.  Same goes for the heat.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't believe I took the time today to get online and review a silly hair dryer.  It just frustrates me so much that I had to do it just in the hope that I might save someone else the trouble of experiencing this thing."	5/2/2013

It's has great power, it's light, easy to handle and it leaves my hair smooth and shinny.  2 Weeks ago it started to fail, I couldn't turn it off, so I'd just unplug it, but this morning it completely stopped working.  So over all, I think I did get my money's worth, because I blow dry my hair every single day and it takes about 10 min, so the price is really good vs. the quality. I even bought another one just now.  Hope this helps."	6/4/2014

"I am not a salon styilst, just someone who likes to dry her hair at home at anytime, even at midnight if it is when the time is available. I used to go to a beaty salon to have my hair dry. It took usually 45-50 minutes for my stylist to dry my hair, which is just not long, thick and wavy: I have a lot of it, too (my stylist used to joke saying I had to heads in one, but sometimes another stylist would come to give her a hand... imagine to people pulling at your hair at the same time... it felt as if they were trying to split my head in two, sometimes!). My stylist is great, and became my great friend, but no matter how well she treated my hair, and how many conditioners, etc. I used, my hair got scorched enough that a some of it was always breaking in half, the natural waviness lost in an ugly way (the half of the hair closest to the roots, the other half wavy still... When I had my hair wet, it looked weird).<br /><br />One day I decided to get myself a blowdryer, and got the FHI 2000. Which turned out to be great, and while drying my hair with difficulty at first, because of my lack of practice, I managed. Seating in front of a mirror, I would bravely spent 1 hour drying my hair. It was worth it! My hair changed a lot, and the huge amounts of money I used to spend at the beaty salon were no longer necessary. Once I encountered my former stylist in the supermarket, and she thought I was visiting another beauty salon, she didn't believe me when I told her it was me (she didnt tell me, but from her face I could tell she didnt believe me).<br /><br />After a bit more than 3 years, my FHi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke. I strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the FHI repair service (if they have any, I dont know, because I live in the Caribbean). I did that, and regretted it a lot, since the repaired dryer damaged my hair. I had to condition it lots and lots afterwards, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).<br /><br />Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback. After using it and learning to manage it (because it is so fast!), I cannot stop myself from congratulating me for my accurate decision! My sister tried it (she has wavy and think hair too), and immediately ordered one for her. I dry my daughter's and mother's hair too. The drying time is much less now, and the hair is great! I notice that while I still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier, the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy, keeping its natural waviness for when I decide to let it dry alone.<br /><br />The Babyliss Pro is powerful, fast, and easy to manage. It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me. I feel that since the blower is so fast, I can avoid the heat fto touch my hair for so long, thus making a more healthier drying experience for my hair everytime. For your info, I use all the buttons at full speed always. I can have my hair ready in 35-40 minutes.ds, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).<br /><br />Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback.

I compared prices between this product and the Leila Ali version. I purchased this version because it was the cheapest of the two. I read the reviews after the purchased, and was disappointed because most of them were negative. People were saying that it only lasted for ten minutes. Contrarily,  the product last as long as I want. However, I have not been successful with roller sets.  I just realized that it has a drawstring on my third use. My roller sets might not have came out the way I wanted because I did not adjust the drawstring and because I need smaller rollers. Other than that, its great for deep conditioning and hot oil treatments. I will try once more for a roller set.

I'd say this cord is about 4 or 5 ft long and only long enough for you to use in the bathroom with a socket close to a mirror.  Other then the cords length it's a perfect go to blue dryer.	11/6/2013

"I've always been skeptical about new, amazing, breakthrough technology in beauty products.  I certainly believe there are different levels of quality and also that one product may perform better or worse on different people.  So I was hoping this dryer would make a difference, while being prepared for less than spectactular results.  So drum roll please...I personally thought my hair looked silkier, shinier and it did dry noticeably faster, but the shocker was that other people really noticed the difference!<br />My adult daughters to whom I am often apparently invisible, both asked me individually and on seperate occassions if I had just had my hair done, and what had I done differently etc.  Ironically, the evening that I had in fact come straight from the salon (and prior to using this product) warranted no notice.  I've had others compliment my hair as well.  I'm giving more weight to those who see me all the time and tend not to use flattery to judge that there was a very noticable difference.<br />  The other thing worth mentioning is that in my youth my hair was one of my best assests in terms of appearance.  For the past 10 years or so, its become a definite liability.  I joke that it's a fire hazard and I'm not allowed near open flame as it is so dry and so covered in product that its quite flammable.  I put a fair bit of effort into getting it to be healthier and less frizzy and I've actually had people ask me if I've ever tried a really good conditioner or anti-frizz product.  After what I hope is a chilling gaze I let them know I do believe I have tried nearly all conditioners/styling products. So it is a rare thing indeed for me to rave about a hair product or in this case hair dryer and I must give it a rave review!<br />  If you possess beautiful, soft, smooth heathly hair this may not be worth the money,  but if like me you color frequently and have those weird coarse alien hairs springing up randomly then I would say go for it!"	1/6/2015

"I'm only giving these a 3/5 for now becuase the heating element was broken on arrival.  I thought it was strange that it didn't get hot even on the highest heat setting...... it was still cool enough after several seconds that I could aim it directly at my face comfortably.  On the second try, it got hot for about 5 seconds.... and then went cool again.  Third try - no heat.  I am glad I kept the box so I can send it back for my replacement.    So I am exchanging this for the same design in hopes that the replacement will have a working heating element.  I still rated it as a moderate success because the high and low settings for air, and the three temperature settings are a wonderful design.  It blows really hard, which is what I like.  I also am hoping the diffuser will allow me to maximize the wave in my hair for those days when I don't want to straighten it (or when it's humid outside).  It's ilghtweight and has a nice feel to the grip.  I hope the replacement will up the rating to a full 5 stars!    UPDATE: I received my replacement (what a simple process, too... kudos for easy returns!), and this hairdryer is perfect for me.  Now that the heating element is working, I am able to see that the heat settings are just what I want, cool is cool, medium is my favorite for regular use, and hot is good and hot but not scorching (I might use this on the low blower setting to set a curl when my hair is in velcro rollers).  Very happy!  Love the feel and heft of it, too."	12/26/2014

It seems very sturdy and yes, it has dried my hair in half the time of my previous ionic dryer.<br /><br />Note that the ionic setting emits less heat so if you need to style your hair you'll need to switch to the other position for more heat.<br /><br />I have round, straight hair, fine but thick and this dryer takes less than 5 minutes to fully dry vs. my other hair dryer I would dry for 5 minutes and walk out the door with wet hair.<br /><br />Also, worth noting that since my last haircut I hadn't been able to get it to look as good as when I walked out of the salon until I used this hair dryer! So now I'm convinced it's all about the hairdryer, forget everything else. Totally worth your money.<br /><br />If I hadn't already purchased this hairdryer I might have gone for the Solano since my hairdresser recommended that one (he also reminded me that the department store/box store dryers are not the same quality ionic dryers and you need at least 1875 watts...) but this one is nearly half the weight of the Solano and pretty darn great."	12/30/2012

There are two settings for ionic, and I don't know what the other setting is supposed to do, but the other setting does introduce static, so I use one ionic setting at all times. The main characteristic I searched for was the sound volume and pitch. Someone wrote a review that said they could actually hear the doorbell ring while using this hairdryer, and that convinced me to purchase this model. It is actually true - the pitch is not really a pitch, but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums. My husband can actually sleep when I blow dry, where he could not before. As for lasting ability, it is a quality hairdryer, and I have been using this for about 6 months and it looks as though it will hold up for the long haul."	12/28/2014

"I did laugh at the target branding to the Male Population for this Mangroomer - I would like have been in the boardroom when that product concept was being reviewed.  I guess they felt this was an under-served market even though the total available market (tam) for men is probably much smaller than the women's market when considering that a) there are alot more bald men than women, b) alot of men barely comb there hair so they certainly don't blowdry it, and c) the wife's hairdryer is already sitting there if needed.  But, if you want a manly hairdryer then I guess this fits the bill.  It does have manly color - evokes feelings of a red Corvette.  It is substantial weight and feels good in the hands.  It appears to have extra horsepower to blow hair in a manly fashion and it has lots of speeds to fiddle with.  In my usage I actually found it to be a good hairdryer - it does the job blowing my short hair around any which way I chose.  But, since my wife has a hairdryer to be honest I don't quite have the bathroom real estate available to store two hairdryers.  Overall, I give it four stars.  A quality product but a bit high on the price/value when considering that there are other serviceable hairdryers that cost less.  Also in terms of necessity factor - for married guys not sure you want a second hairdryer in the bathroom.  But if I was a single guy with a red corvette and Fabio hair and I had to have a hairdryer in my bathroom then I guess this would be the one."	2/16/2012

I figured she'd be the perfect person to rate this against a number of other dryers. Here's what she said:<br /><br />First of all, this hair dryer looks sleek (chocolate brown with powder pink accents) and it doesn't look bad or distracting just sitting by the sink or on the dresser. (Some huge salon models that look like they power wind tunnels are much more obtrusive.) This one is rather long and slightly heavier, however, than the Con Air Infinity hair dryer I've been using, so it took a little getting used to the heft. The noise level is average (the same as Con Air), but it dries my hair much faster and seems like it gives more volume to my hair. The speed also allows me to style my hair better and it stays that way longer. While most blow dryers have multiple settings, this Remington really has noticeable differences between the settings, with warm being warm and hot actually being hot instead of a little warmer. The selection switches on this model are also much easier to change to get to those settings, and unlike most slide switch type models, they can be changed on the fly while styling without having to fumble and fret with the dryer. No doubt about it, I'm completely satisfied with this dryer.<br /><br />So of course, we give it five stars."	11/22/2010

In shock, I threw the dryer to the ground where it continued to spark and hiss a few more times until it died. I figured it must have reached it's end after a long life of use, but after reading some of the other reviews here I am surprised to learn that this has happened to others, and so soon after their purchase.

"The purpose of a sonic toothbrush to augment the normal cleaning abilities of bristles by moving them rapidly and also to generate a secondary, cavitation effect, removing biofilms beyond the reach of the actual bristles. These Sonic Seals defeat these mechanics of Flexcare toothbrushes by filling the gap that allows the brush head to clear the handle, dampening the oscillations intended to be transmitted to the brush head and sending some of them back into the handle.

The difference isn't as miraculous as I was hoping it would be but it's still a very good hairdryer.  When I used it with no attachments it blew my hair into oblivion but dried my very thick hair in record time.  Not a hairdo I could leave the house with though.  But when I used the curly hair attachment (the one with the prongs) it worked perfectly (albeit taking longer to dry).  My only complaint is that the buttons are placed right where my hand holds the dryer which means that until I got used to adjusting my grip, I would constantly be turning it off or changing the settings inadvertently.  I don't really like the way that I have to gingerly hold the thing to avoid this.  Overall, if you're looking to upgrade to a grown-up hair dryer, this one is a good one."	1/19/2012

I give it 5 stars because I think it is a great hair dryer overall for my purposes, and excellent also for the price.      I don't use this for travel but really like the retractable cord.  Actually I don't bother retracting it, but like the fact that I can keep just a relatively short but usable length of cord out all the time, which doesn't clutter up the counter.  With every other hair dryer I have ever had the cord was way too long and got in the way.  This hair dryer wouldn't be my first choice for travel, by the way, because it is a bit big and heavy as compared to other travel hair dryers.    At the maximum speed the airflow is probably less than most other dryers, but is sufficient for me.  Another potential negative for some people might be the larger than normal handle circumference, but you get used to it, and for me this size is actually perfect.    Another surprise regarding this hair dryer is that my hair is more shiny now, it must be the ceramic or ionic thing.  Being ceramic it is supposed to have more even heat, which is less likely to damage your hair.  Whatever is causing this effect, I like it, and was noticeable right away.    Lastly I am guessing this will last a while, given the 5 year warranty.  I previously was using another $20 hair dryer purchased at a local store, and they lasted an average of 6 months before breaking.  This one seems like it will last, and I won't have any issues with the cord retraction mechanism possibly wearing out since I never change the cord length."	6/5/2011
