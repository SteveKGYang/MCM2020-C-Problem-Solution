There aren't many old-fashioned bonnet hair dryers around anymore. This one replaces a decades old GE unit that developed severe rattles and then terminal switch failure. <br /> <br />My wife really likes the compact size, relatively low noise, comfort of the product and storage of the tube and bonnet inside the unit's case. I'd give the style designer a big attaboy. The unit is much easier to store away than the old one. <br /> <br />The only negative comment was that she wishes the unit had one more lower heat option; she gets pretty warm even at low heat. However, she may be happier when our good old Wisconsin winter setles in and the house is a little cooler."	9/6/2005

"I have thick, not coarse, but not silky hair.  I rarely blow dry my hair since it takes so long (maybe 7-10 minutes) with my old hair dryer, and I thought it made my hair coarser.  I decided to give the ion thing a try though, and it was the best investment (in time) ever.  It only takes  two or three minutes on high speed, medium heat to dry an entire head of shoulder-length hair!  (I don't blow until it's bone dry, just dry to the touch.)  After the first time, my hair was super soft.  After the second time, it got even softer and I thought it had more body too.  I've only had it a week, so we'll see how it holds up, but the ions really do work.  I'll probably never air dry again!"	2/24/2006

Some reviewers have mentioned it being heavy. Not true, maybe for a three year old, but not an adult. It just feels like a nice solid, well made dryer. It's louder than my last dryer, but not too loud. I don't think that whole ion thing does anything no matter which dryer you use. My hair is the same, with or without ions. What smooths it out is the fact that it blows nice and hard. That will probably change though as the filter gets clogged inside. That remains to be seen. I'm happy with it."	2/15/2008

"I've had two.  First one quit working in 2 months.  Replacement ALSO quit working after 3 months.  I still haven't gotten all the gory details on WHERE to send this second defective unit.  Plus, I have to pay to ship it there AND include a check for $14.95 for processing.  Some warranty. It may be 4 years, but is it worth the hassle - time & expense - of returning every 3-4 months?  The worst part is that the first one was a gift from my sister-in-law and she was mortified so handled the first replacement...the store kindly exchanged it for her.  She paid $200 for the darn thing, so I would hope so!  In any case, I did not want to prevail upon her kindness again, so decided to handle this one myself.  I go to the web site - no info there - says to call them.  I call them.  They tell me to go to the website and send an email.  Huh?  Why couldn't they have just said that on the website?  I suspect because they have a LOT of defective units but don't want people to guess that, and if they had the warranty info there, well, it would be a negative and not a positive.  At any case, and at that kind of money, there should be better quality control (AND WARRANTY instructions!) so that I don't have to go thru this every 3 months!  What is wrong with this picture?  Yes, buy it if you want to deal with the warranty mess and inconvenience and cost.  You'll love it for the 3 months, miss it for 2 months while awaiting the warranty info/replacement...and then the cycle will begin again.  I have very thick hair with waves and it works wonders and leaves my hair shiny.  But, geesh, I could never recommend it to anyone.  $200 and I have to send it back for warranty every 2-3 months.  Hello??? Bespoke are you listening????  My friends would never forgive me if I recommended such a poor quality product to them.  Now that I had to prevail upon my sister-in-law to get her receipt, and I have it in hand, I can now spend my money to send the thing back.  This has added 3 weeks to the delay, but I have FOUR YEARS.  At this rate, they will probably wait until just about the end of that period to send me a replacement so the new one will be out of warranty practically when it arrives.  I got the first one in late Dec 2006.  The second one in mid-Marchlay, but I have FOUR YEARS.

The product lathers up very well, but rinses clean easily, leaving my hands soft and feeling healthy and refreshed, but not at all greasy like a moisturizer usually feels. The scent lingers only for a little while and does not make me feel like I am leaving it behind in foods I prepare after washing my hands. I've had guests over since I bought this soap and both times they commented on what a lovely scent it had when they washed their hands in the bathroom. This is my favorite so far in any of the types and scents available from standard brands of liquid antibacterial soaps in a pump container. I also love that I could buy in volume at a good price, so as to not run out suddently.

The price for a professional hair dryer could be very expensive considering I am not a hairstylist; so I brought this..it was priced in the middle.  I totally love this Elchim!!! I have curly hair and I could straighten it or wear it curly with no frizz.  I would recommend this product.  It's worth every penny.	10/8/2012

Several years ago my old professional blow dryer died, and I ended up replacing it with the best that Walmart could provide. It seemed to have all the latest and greatest technology and bells and whistles (3 heat settings, cool button, 3 air speeds with ion, ceramic heat), but my hair just wasn't getting dry. By the time my hair dried my scalp was soaked, and my hair was was still frizzy no matter how much anti-frizz hair product I used. I have what a hair professional termed textured hair. It's thick, porous, dries slowly because it retains moisture, and tends to frizz.     This blow dryer dries my hair fast, straight, and my hair feels great. It takes half the time to actually get my hair dry now, and my scalp isn't soaked afterwards. This blow dryer gives me the same results as my salon visits. Big revelation....not all blow dryers are alike.    This blow dryer is an investment, but thanks to the great reviews I was confident in giving it a try, and I'm so glad I did.

I have tried several, including a myriad of non-greasy moisturizers. So far, nothing has worked as advertised. My dermatologist recommended this. Miraculously, this actually absorbs within minutes, and does not leave a greasy feeling at all. Of course, there is a trade-off. If you have very dry skin, you will have to use this 3-4 times a day to really be effective. Less, if your dryness isn't that bad. It has no smell, and won't aggravate acne. Really tho, the only thing I care about is how fast it absorbs. As long as I use it regularly, it keeps my skin nicely moisturized. I definitely recommend this to anyone who also needs a non-greasy moisturizer."	8/5/2010

"I love tsi-la. Their scents are great and all natural without making you smell like an incense shop. I've tried other natural scents that are overpowering or as my non-crunchy sister would say it smells ethnic in here when I walk into a room. Moving on, all the tsi-la scents I've tried are great. I dont use perfume every day, but I keep this little rollerball in my purse cosmetic bag in case I go to an afterwork event or to freshen up if I'm on the go all day before meeting someone out. I'm no scent expert, but to me Fiori d'Arancio smells like *delicate fruit loops* Ok that sounds totally wacky but its a sweet, clean fruity smell, and smells natural--you can tell there arent chemicals in the scent unlike gross body splashes and stuff. its really hard to find a way to smell these before purchasing too, (occasionally you can find sample vials on an auction or deal site) and they are expensive, so the mini is a great way to test it out in an affordable way before upgrading to a full size. If the fruit loop smell is not for you, pass it on to a teenage girl you love. Personally I love it! Sometimes I mix it with my lavanilla rollerball for a delicious fruity vanilla scent! If you are concerned that perfume has toxic, hormone distrupting stuff in it, you owe it to yourself to try Tsi-La!"	1/9/2012

I saw this hair dryer at a hotel recently. Its performance was impressive for its size. As soon as I got home I ordered one. I found the included mounting kit (screws, 3M tape, dry wall anchors) a little flimsy. I used a better wall anchor to mount the dryer.<br /><br />All was well for 3 days. The hair dryer worked like a champ, until the third day when the on/off switch blew up in my hands. The switch had shorted out, causing a large poof of smoke/fire. This of course happened just after I had tossed the original packaging and Amazon shipping box. So I contacted the manufacture about a replacement. They were VERY interested in getting this dryer to the corporate offices ASAP. They sent out FedEx the next day to pick up the device to be sent back.

I would not suggest this item for women of darker skin. I myself am Caucasian but I have medium thickness, curly hair and I can just barely use it.

The Tan Towels were just getting to be very pricey.  I found that these ones work just as well as the others! However, it seems like it takes a few more applications with the Loreal brand to get the same color as Tan Towels, but for this price that hardly matters.  Some may even think this is a positive, because it allows you more control over your tan.  I used these every night for 3 days and I have a wonderful natural looking glow.  Not too dark at all and not overly noticable.  These are great for us fair skinned folks that only need a bit of color.  I'm not sure you can call this a deep dark tan, but that wasn't what I was looking for anyway. These take a bit of practice to use (since you can't see where it is going on), but after becoming an expert with the Tan Towels, these were easy. Always use a circular motion! Also, I found that putting a little bit of lotion on my writs after application really helps with the steaking on my wrists (this was a problem area for me). AND, I wash my hands immediately afterward and use the MUCH lighter Jergens natural glow lotion on my hands instead, this also helps with the streaking factor."	1/9/2012

This is it. My hair is thin and wimpy, but still takes several minutes to dry. The longer it takes to dry, the frizzier it gets. (I'm not a pro when it comes to drying my hair. Far from it.) Even if the humidity is high, with this dryer my hair dries fast, frizz-free and straight.     It is heavy for my arthritic hands and arms, so I use a hair dryer stand, similar to [...], that I purchased many years ago at a drug store in their Made for TV section. I haven't timed it, but it seems to take less than five minutes to completely dry my hair.     The cord is approximately six feet long, long enough for my use since I don't walk around while drying my hair. The temperature and air control on the handle are slide levers. With arthritis, particularly bad in my thumbs, I find it somewhat difficult to adjust them, thus the four-star rating.     Color-wise, I'd describe it as a rich salmon. I don't see a purpose to the clear encasement over the dual fans, but that doesn't bother me one way or the other.     Over all, I'm very glad I made this purchase and I do recommend it for people who don't like spending a lot of time under the dryer."	12/16/2011

It is a tiny bit quieter, but still makes a decent amount of noise (about the same as a powerful hand vacuum).  It is a perfect size for the bathroom.  The only thing I would change is to make the power cord recoil as it is nice and long, but must be wrapped up after each use or left to hang.  That said, I still highly recommend this hair dryer."	9/7/2008

The dryer has a nice array of settings; I usually put it on the hottest setting because the others don't seem warm enough. The cool setting works well, too. The dryer is fairly quiet, too, even at high settings, which is a huge change from my travel dryer. The one drawback I've found so far is the weight of this dryer. My travel dryer was of course very light and compact so it's been an adjustment getting used to the size and weight of this one. My arm gets a little tired as I'm finishing, but it's not a big problem. Definitely a good purchase!"	1/16/2011

The reason I bought this hair dryer is because of the retractable cord and the folding handle. The fact that it's a great dryer and ionic was a plus. My only complaint is the cord does not always retract back into the dryer. You have to pull it out and try again. If you're not careful and pull too much it will be stuck out permanently. This happened to me . I tried taking apart the dryer to fix it but ended up throwing the blow dryer away because I couldn't get it back together.

Well, gotta keep her happy so I got it for her. After her using it for about a year, I must say that it really does work better then the cheaper hair dryers she's been using.    Her hair tends to get frizzy and this dryer really does solve that problem a lot better the $25 hair dryer she was using before. It seems well constructed. MAKE SURE you clean out the filter under the back end cap!! It kept stopping every 5-8 minutes & my wife thought it was overheating. But I noticed that the filter was clogged. After cleaning it, the hair dryer was back to normal.

I didnt expect anything from this $13 dryer, but figured what could it hurt to have something less bulky to travel with to the beach that works internationally. I used it at home a few times and I am IMPRESSED. I've spent HUNDREDS of dollars on T3, CHI Pro, Superstar -- and they all work GREAT. Well, while this isnt  100% comparable, its near 80% comparable. Fantastic quality! This is one of your best bets for a good quality, high heat/non damaging air flow cheap travel blow dryer that doesnt cost a fortune. I will say that my hair frizzed up much easier when I hit the DC humidity than it does when I use my other blow dryers.

However, an Andrew Jackson will get you the Conair 209R Ion Shine 1875 watt hair dryer from Amazon.com, and your even have some change left over!  This dryer produces an impressive jet stream of air, with a selection of 3 heat settings.  The technical specifications boast Clouds of negatively-charged ions neutralize positive charges that are in the air and reduce the static electricity that causes fly-away frizzies and dulls hair.  Well, I don't know what all of that means but I will admit that my hair is not frizzy after using this dryer.  There is also a cold-shot button, which quickly removes heat from the air output, which is a great feature.  The dryer has a little weight to it, but it is not bulky and seems to be balanced quite well.  All hair dryers are fairly noisey but this Conair 209R Ion Shine is quieter than most of my previous dryers.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this model, the built-in cord retractor, seems to be getting negative comments from other reviewers here on Amazon.  Common sense tells me that I should hold onto the heavy power adapter with one hand while holding in the cord release buttong with the other.  You easily control the retraction speed this way, which prevents the end from whipping around as most people are complaining about.  It's really not a big deal and doesn't take much effort on the user's part.<br /><br />I do wish that this dryer had three air speed settings, since high is sometimes too harsh, and the low setting is usually too soft.  Overall, for less than $20.00 this is a real bargain of a hair dryer and I couldn't be much happier with my purchase.  Thanks for the great deal Amazon!  =o)"	1/11/2008

Could be 5 star if it had more 'blow' to it	"Pros:  ceramic heating component  lightweight  quiet    Cons:  the 'blow' component isn't all that strong  has only a low and high setting  plastic casing feels cheap (but that's probably partly why it's so light)  obnoxious color    This could be a 5 star blow drier if they had just given it a little more power. I purchased it because I was excited about the good reviews. It does a pretty-good job, but the problem is that the 'blow' action of it is really weak. To use it I have to use the funneling head attachment, but there is almost no airflow on the low setting. Because there isn't a very high volume of air running through the dryer, the air is also a bit hotter than I'd really like it to be and I worry about damaging my hair... I find that I need to cut my hair more frequently since I've purchased this blow drier. I'm going to shop around in the near future for a better dryer. It's ok for now, and if not for the ceramic heat I would have returned it, but I wouldn't get it again."	2/27/2008

This dryer is like a miracle!  Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  I'm telling you, if this dryer can work this well on my hair it can work for anyone.  I've tried other expensive dryers that women rave about and they were all a waste of money compared to this one.    First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  In just about every way this dryer makes you think it's not up to the task but if you give it a chance you'll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    For instance, this dryer does not seem to put out a lot of air.  People tend to think it doesn't have enough power but that's not because it isn't working, it's because it doesn't need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn't poof up your hair.  If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  The only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently.  Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  I feel so much less stressed out using this dryer, too.  It's quieter, lighter and doesn't require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  I'll swear it takes less time to dry my hair, although I haven't estimated by how much.  It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     One thing that is strange about this dryer (but not in a bad way) is that at first I thought I was seeing smoke rising from my hair when I used it.  This alarmed me because I thought I was damaging my hair.  Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  It has no smell and it seems like water vapor.  I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I've been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  I sometimes feel like I've used a relaxer on my hair!    The only complaint I have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things.  The control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature.  There are 2 independent speed controls and 3 temperature controls.    Other than that, I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  I often see women with thick curly hair act as if their hair type is the hardest to handle and if a dryer can work on them it can work on anyone.  Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  Personally, when I have seen bad reviews of this dryer I think it's because the person hasn't learned how to use it yet and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer.  If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  Now if they can only come out with a model that will shine shoes too!  ;-)    UPDATE May, 2008:  I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it's still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever and I am still thrilled with its performance!"	6/15/2007

But, it doesn't seem to move the air as strong as my YellowBird does. It seems a little underpowered, I'm still going to search for perhaps a 2200 Watt dryer, if I can find one. I want a dryer that has more power, not necessarily more heat.<br /><br />Heat settings are good- the highest heat is quite hot. I use the second-highest setting. It's nice to also have a no-heat setting. But the no-heat only works on low power, with is useless.

I have a small bathroom and I really like its compact size and that it folds up.  The hot dries really fast and I like the cold blast feature.    That said, the high/low/on/off switch drives me insane.  If my hands are a little bit wet (which given that I'm drying wet hair they often are) I have a hard time getting a grip on the switch with my thumb and getting it turned off and on.  Also, it seems like the nozzle doesn't attach 100% (maybe about 95%) so it just falls off sometimes while I'm drying my hair.

I wasn't planning on paying a ton for a dryer, my daughter's a professional & I don't see any difference in her high priced ones, except they are for professional wear & tear!<br />I have fairly long, course, thick hair, that has always taken FOREVER to dry. Well, my hair was dry in half the time & it is lighter than my other dryer, so it didnt kill my shoulder & irritate my arthritis. It has a nice defusser, nice & small, not long like others so you can actually hold it away from your hair & not burn your hair or scalp. I am very pleased so far & will look for other hair care products by this company. I definetly would recommend it!!"	6/18/2012

She said she even takes it home evenings and weekends to use on her own hair. Bad news- it cost about $350! I wrote down the model and thought i would just see what I could find. I couldn't believe it when I found it on here for under $100! I got it within three days of placing my order and tried it right away. It was truly amazing the difference it made with my hair. I have thinner hair with a natural wave so when it dries it dries more curly and frizzy so I usually use a round brush with a dryer to straighten and smooth it. With this dryer, it was shinier and smoother in half the time. I have been able to come close to how it looks when it is professionally blown out. For all those who don't think a dryer makes a difference - I'm telling you this one did for me. Couldn't be happier with the purchase."	8/17/2010

But recently I had my hair straightened and the beautician suggested to blow dry out after washing.  She told me the Elchim Professional 2001 was the best and they last for a long time.  She had many years on her dryer and it is used lots everyday.  That sounded like the best option for me.  If I was going to invest, I wanted it to be good and have a long happy life.  It seems to be well balanced and has lots of power.  My thick hair is dry in 10 minutes.  I am very satisfied with my purchase and no regrets.  The product was delivered quickly.  I was suprised that the dryer was in a box with no packing to secure it inside.  I thought that was odd.  I am sure that it was bounced around from the wearhouse and across the nation by all who touched it.  That part did concern.  I hope it did not affect the life of my product.  Time will tell.

"I am so entirely pleased with this hair dryer that I'm coming back for another one... 2 1/2 years later. I've burned through cheaper, store-bought hair dryers in the past. I bought an Andis many years ago and it was wonderful, so I bought this model in June 2009, and sadly today in December 2011 it finally fizzled out.<br /><br />The dryer works extremely quickly. I remember comparing it to the past model I had, and the reason I've stuck with Andis since because of their efficiency (and longevity). I have naturally loose-curly hair, and I use this dryer daily to straighten my hair with a round brush. It allows my hair to retain a lot of body, come out super-soft, and avoid frizz!<br /><br />While the switches on the handle are kind of in a bad place, I eventually got used to it and rarely do I accidentally turn it off. It's not hard to turn back on, so I don't see it as that big of an issue.<br /><br />I've had great customer service experience with Andis in the past as well. The plastic piece that holds the filter on the back of the dryer (at the air intake) broke and no longer functioned. I also broke one of the attachments. I called their customer service number and they replaced both items free of charge, even though I'd had the dryer for more than a year!"	12/16/2011

"I've owned various blowdryers through the years, but this one is my favorite by far. It's relatively lightweight (though I wouldn't say it's featherweight, but it is quite a bit lighter than most dryers on the market), dries hair faster than any other dryer I've used, and generally creates smoother, shinier results. I love that you can pop-off the back and replace/clean the little air filter, since most of my dryers in the past lost power over time because the filter got clogged with dust and I couldn't clean it.     After my most recent cut my stylist gave me a blowout with this dryer, so I knew it was reliable. The way I see it, I wear my hair every day and it surrounds my face, so it's worth investing in a tool that will give me consistently great results that improve my appearance. I highly recommend this dryer!    And by the way, I purchased it from someone on Amazon who was selling a new one for about a hundred dollars. It was a great value and I've had no problems with it!"	10/15/2010

"I've had this dryer for a little over a year.  Worked well, dried quickly and although not small the dryer is lightweight for its size. But just had a huge scare this morning while drying my hair.  The cord literally broke off from the base sending a flare up of fire into the air and exposing the wires! I've had much cheaper dryer's for years and I've never experienced anything like this. Major safety issue and now i have a $100 dryer thats unusable after a little more then a year.  I have a message into Amazon.com but i suspect since its been a little over a year any warranty that was offered is no longer valid.  I'll update this review when i get a response.  (As far as its use, it was used about 5x per week and although it had a long cord I used it right by the outlet so it wasn't stretch or tugged.  The cord did get twisted up much easier then far cheaper dryers and other appliances and this may have contributed to the problem.)"	6/14/2010

I have never timed how long it takes to dry my hair as I take my time, do part, get tired and come back to it, etc.  My hair is super thick and longish (past my shoulders by a few inches.)  SO, I start to dry my hair and not only did it seem that it dried much faster, but I was able to get it SO much straighter than with my cheapo ionic dryer that I had been using previously.  I usually dry as well as I can and then have to spend another 10 minutes with the iron to smooth out the mess.  I only used the iron for a small section in the back that I hadn't hit well enough with the dryer.

I hadn't planned on retracting the cord each time, as that seemed like it would shorten the time the dryer lasted.  But I did it once, and it was trouble to not get it past the red line.  The dryer handle was also was very large, and hard to hold without my hand cramping.  Still, I kept it, as the ionic feature seemed to be good for straightening out my curly hair. After less than two months, the power button died, and I could not turn it off.  I had to reset the outlet.  When I checked about returns, it would cost me $10.00 for the return, and they would only return half of the purchase price.  So I would wind up with around $5.00 for my trouble.  And I still wouldn't have a dryer to use, as I did not want to have it replaced.  I wonder if the company has this policy so no one will bother to return the item?"	11/27/2011

But- This Item must be turned off completely after each use near where  the unit was installed at the rear of the toliet near the floor!!   You and or your guests have to remember this.(Stated in the directions)   In Asia where these are very popular you do not have to turn the unit off after each use.  Mine leaks a little either in the open postion or closed postion while hanging on the wall!!!   I would say to look for a better unit before buying this one- I was very dissappointed in the quality.	8/5/2010

I have not worked up the nerve yet to try cutting my own hair, but have used it to cut someone elses hair and it worked fine. I am a little concerned how well it will hold up over time as the different combs are made of plastic that seems kind of light.... not sure how well it will last, and if dropped I am sure it would be easily broken. The cutting length settings work well, although I would have preferred a longer setting be available. I used the longest settings for the top (maybe 1.5), shorter settings for the side, and the shortest settings around the ears and back for a tight taper. It can cut very short and the cutting blades seem to be plenty sharp, giving a good cut. I do wish there would have been more guidance on How-To to give the user confidence in cutting their own hair. I would suggest the manufacturer prepare an online video to teach you how to use it to cut your own hair yourself. So far I have not used it on myself and need to use it a few times on others to develop confidence in doing so."	1/9/2012

As I was holding it above my head, drying my hair, I heard a pop.  A few sparks flew out the end and into my hair and the whole thing shut off.  As it turns out, the area where the cord attaches to the handle got so hot that it melted through the plastic coating, exposing about a half-inch of singed wires. A tad bit dangerous if you asked me!  Granted, I used this dryer on the highest heat setting everyday for a year, so I got a lot of use out of it, but every other hairdryer I've had in the past simply blows cold air when it stops working properly--this one could've caused me bodily harm.

With Moisture Surge, there's no fear of that.  It smoothes on easily,  is instantly absorbed, and leaves a lovely surface for applying   makeup or (if in neck area) just feeling soft and enriched.    I use my fingertips for application and they are also left completely  dry in mere seconds, so no searching for a rag or tissue to mop off   excess... there simply isn't any need.  You can immediately put the  top back on the tube to save it from drying out.  Having moderate skin, I can only guess that someone with excessively   dry dermis might not find this sufficiently moisturizing.  Also just a   guess:  the younger you are, the less you probably need.  I'm not a   spring chicken and I find a little does go quite a way.  There is no odor and no wetness left a few seconds after application.   Just lovely feeling skin.  I wish I could afford a larger size, as this is   not inexpensive (my rationale for 4 of 5 stars only).

It is very professional looking and as others have mentioned it is feels soft and velvety to the touch. It dries my hair quickly and is not too loud, all things considered.  I would say for smoothing it is not a miracle worker, but it does much better than your cheapie dryers, and can help an amateur like me control the frizz somewhat.  I think super smoothing requires more proper technique than just a magic hair dryer.  Unfortunately I am not well versed in that technique, but with this dryer my hair doesn't look too frazzled and out of control.  My only issue with this dryer is that I have very long hair and sometimes when I am using it the hair gets sucked into the fan on the back end of the dryer.  I think this is because this dryer is smaller than my last dryer so I need to adjust for this better. Overall though, its the best quality for the price I have had in a dryer."	12/29/2011

This dryer has won me over completely. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it soft - again, having chemically treated, porous hair means that some dryers have left my hair feeling crunchy and looking frizzy. Not so with Deep Brilliance! I think it's a great product at a reasonable price - $40 is a LOT cheaper than most professional quality ceramic models I've looked into. For someone with damaged hair needing TLC, this is awesome. I can actually use less styling products thanks to the smooth finish I get just from the dryer. I didn't find myself wanting more power, as some reviewers have mentioned, but this may be because my hair is porous and not terribly thick.  The only negatives I can think of would be that the styling attachments become quite hot very quickly (thus you have to be careful when removing them right after use), and perhaps for someone with very thick hair, 1300 watts won't cut it."	2/28/2008

This is my third hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient.  The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  My second one ([[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]), which I used for only a couple months, was also noisy.  The cord in it was also too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand.  I had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  I couldn't imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  I don't care about the weight--it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium-length (for a man) hair.  The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  I no longer have to turn up my radio to hear the news while drying my hair.  It has independent controls for heat and speed.  I usually like to use high heat with the low speed so it doesn't blow my hair so much.  The 5-foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation.  I would not describe the quietness of the dryer as slightly better than the cheaper driers I have used before--it is a dramatic difference.  I have often wondered about the potential hearing loss my old dryers might cause, but didn't worry too much because it didn't take very long to dry my hair.  If I still had long hair, I would be seriously concerned about the noise from a cheap dryer.  As for how well my hair looks after using it, I notice no difference from the other dryers.  My hair if very fineand thick with some wave, so it is pretty easy to care for.  It will frizz in high humidity, but I live in Denver and humidity is not a problem here.  I have not tried this in a humid environment.  I highly recommend this dryer.  Update on 2010-10-17: This dryer is still working great and I still consider it the best dryer I've ever used.  Update on 2011-12-29: I cut my hair shorter last April and no longer use the hair dryer.  It was still working perfectly after three years."	4/26/2008

After moving to a different city and a different job, I no longer needed the super power that this dryer gave me.  My hair does better air dried and if you listen to all the stylists in the media, they say blow drying your hair every day would damage it so a quick few seconds for the bangs and I was out the door.  With the limited space in our bathroom after moving, the hair dryer took up more space than was warranted for it.  Sure I wasn't spending another few dollars to buy something I already had, but the frustration of never having a clean looking sink counter had been eating at my peace of mind.    After a few trips where the hotel had a wall mounted hair dryer that suited my need just fine, I talked the hubby into putting out the funds for a wall mounted dryer.  I hemmed and hawed about which dryer I should buy.  Mostly, it came down to price and the loop for the cord.  Didn't need the nightlight, but after a couple of nights, the soft green glow came in handy when waking up in the middle of the night due to cats or a need to use the toilet.  Even the hubby who is sensitive to light at night was comfortable with it as long as it wasn't facing the bed.    The loop on the back is flat and not a circle so you have to hook the cord over it just like in the picture.  I had expected it to be a full circle sticking out from the wall, but it sits flush.  Still, the cord does stay in place so I can't complain.  I have a good hair dryer and it's finally off the counter!"	1/30/2010

I've had many other 1875w dryers and this one was a bit louder than my previous ones. About a week ago, the hair dryer stopped producing warm/hot air and now it just blows cold air. Had to throw it out and purchase a different hair dryer. This might just be a one time scenario... but I wouldn't purchase again."	12/8/2012

I have been careful to sort of break in the first one by using low power for a minute before going to high power and then to switch to low power when I am finished before turning off.  I was concerned since several reviews stated that they had problems with the unit failing after using it only for a short time.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase and am considering buying two more to keep as reserves.  It is almost impossible to buy 1600 W dryers now and even harder to find dryers than have the side mounted motors and fans which I like.  The new 1875 W dryers can cause circuit breakers to trip and I don't feel we need that much heat on our hair. We must all remember that in this economy everyone is trying to cut costs, and that pertains to hairdryers as well as everything else.  Anything we can do to reduce the shock to a new appliance can possibly lengthen the life of the product.  Nothing lasts as long as they used to as we have found with clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators, dish washers, AC units etc.  However, so far, I am extremely pleased with this hairdryer.  Hopefully that will stay the same for months ahead."	9/13/2012

So, it seemed perfect for my short, thin hair.  And I am satisfied.  Even at the same 1875 Watts as my old Conair dryer, this one does not seem to get very hot and it does take longer to dry my hair, about 10-15 minutes longer.

I have some hyperpigmentation from sun damage and monthly blemishes.  I have maybe had 2 facials in my life so my skin was not used to such a high concentration of salicylic acid, or any other kind of acid for that matter.  I have used the product about 4 times now.  The first time I used it I literally felt like the skin was burning off my face.  After the fourth use it's at the point where it still burns but it's not unbearable and I can last the whole 10 minutes.      Although the peel is painful it has definitely been worth it.  I was afraid I would have a lot of dry skin on my face which would show through my makeup since I have semi-dry skin already but it honestly wasn't that bad.  There were probably 3 small dry patches but you couldn't see them through my makeup and after the second day I used a dry washcloth and wiped the dry skin off.  My skin is very smooth now and the hyperpigmentation is almost gone.  Before I would never go out in public without makeup on because I felt like people could see my age in the condition of my skin but now I have no problem going out with a clean face.  I have used a number of products of all price ranges in the past to minimize the hyperpigmentation and nothing ever worked.  This is the first product I have ever used with success.      If you can't stand the pain and can only tolerate a minute or two the first couple times you use this product you will still see outstanding results.  Also, it says to use lotion after using the peel but I have been putting on toner and that has really been a more effective way of moisturizing my skin immediately after using the peel.    I gave this product 4 starts out of 5 due to the pain.  As far as effectiveness is concerned it deserves 5 stars but the stinging is really unpleasant."	12/4/2010

The one strange thing is I couldn't find anywhere that said how many watts it has, and now I own it and still, none of the packing materials, box, insert or even the dryer itself says how many watts, which is odd.  But it has enough power for me (my old dryer had 1875).  For $40, its fine.  Had I paid the $259 supposed sticker price, I'd be disappointed.

When I got to Europe, I tried to change the voltage on it and was totally disappointed. The voltage changer looks like you would use a coin or a screw driver to turn it. When I turned the knob, it fell out of the appliance completely revealing that it wasn't attached to anything within the appliance!! It was just a hole with a little black plug that seemed to be put there to make it look like it would change the voltage. Of course, as soon as my traveling companion plugged it in the 250 volt outlet, it began to smoke. What a rip off!!!

If it's worked well for 45 years, that's a pretty good recommendation.  That's how I feel about these Revlon tweezers. Mine - which I've really had for about 45 years, I think, mysteriously disappeared recently.  Someday they'll probably just as mysteriously reappear.  In the meantime, I couldn't find a replacement, have never been able to use the flat-edged ones, and was reluctant to spend a lot of money on expensive tweezers that get somewhat mixed reviews.  Since the latter two categories were the only types I could find in my local stores, I was glad to find the Revlon tweezers here.  And you know what? As I'm sitting here typing this, it occurs to me that, now that I know these are the real deal, I'd be a fool not to go ahead and order another pair, while they're still available, just in case my new ones disappear anytime within the next 45 years.

This is USEFUL for you stylish gents who are not just looking for a device to merely dry hair.<br /><br />I find that the high setting air current is not strong enough to really get your hair into staying straight upwards (if you're going for a mohawk or even a pompadour) and keep it there (the way some of the stronger hairdryers can). Especially if you have a thicker hair structure (wavy, curly), or your hair falls naturally in a certain way but you want it to be styled in an opposite direction. Using more hair product helps a little, but a stronger air current will work better (even though it is more damaging for your hair & scalp, so USE CAREFULLY AND WISELY)<br /><br />I figured there are enough men out there looking for just this function, so I figured I'd help you all out."	2/9/2011

At the time, the Jerdon 1600W had all good reviews and was one of the least expensive options.  We liked its clean and symmetric design better than its competitors.  Anyhow, after 6 weeks of daily use, it still works fine--according to my wife.  It has plenty of power and does have a switch on the handle for off/low/med/high.  If it is on when you try to hang it onto the wall base, it automatically flips the switch to the 'off' position.  Most importantly (to me) the bathroom looks clean and uncluttered and I can use the countertop once again.  The only thing that seems a little strange in my home bathroom (rather than a hotel) is that First Class is printed on the handle (as can be seen in the photo)."	2/23/2006

I was a bit hesitant to get a fold-able travel dryer since their reviews don't tend to be as good, however this one was the exception, which is why I went for it. The main features I was looking for in a new dryer was the weight, size, power and I would prefer it to be a ceramic dryer since they are healthier on your hair. My old dryer was the Vidal Sassoon VS501 1875W Ionic Sensor Touch Dryer. The VS501 lasted me several years and technically it still works. I've dropped it enough times that the front cover has broken making it a bit difficult to work the buttons. Below I have compared the two dryers:<br /><br />Conair 173RZ VS. Vidal Sassoon VS501<br /><br />Conair 173RZ Pros:<br />Lighter and smaller than the VS501, which is easier on my arm<br />Puts out more air than the VS501<br />Folds up for easy storage and travel<br /><br />Conair 173RZ Cons:<br />Not as hot as the VS501, but still drys hair just as fast if not faster due to the air flow<br />Shorter cord than the VS501, which unless you need it can make it easier to store<br /><br />Overall Summery:<br />The Conair is a great buy with the features of a full size dryer packed into a small, fold-able, lightweight design.

It is very noisy and I have to turn the radio up loud to hear the news--even when using the slow speed.  You should be concerned about hearing loss if you use this.  The cord is way too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewinds so quickly that the plug whips around and hits me painfully in the hand.  I have to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.

This blow dryer is great for the price.  Just don't expect a $100+ ionic dryer.  You get a nice $18 dryer for $18 - simple. <br />2. Nice looking, sleek design, with retractable cord.  This is not a compact dryer for travel - it should be considered more of a mid-size. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />1.  Retractable cord is quite short, which could be a problem if your outlet is not very close by.   <br />2.  Very loud!  I saw others complain about this, and now I know what they mean.  It's loud.  <br />3.  The retractable cord failed to retract after a couple of uses.  This is disappointing considering it was a major factor in my purchase. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: <br />Does it dry hair quickly and make it smooth and silky??  No more than any other dryer.  It's a nice, inexpensive, blow dryer, but I personally would not purchase it again. <br />"	5/28/2006

"I spent a lot of time researching which hair dryer I wanted to purchase and I decided the Conair Infiniti Cord Reel was exactly what I was looking for. I always go to Amazon first when making a purchase so naturally I checked to see if it was available. It was in stock, listed for a great price and also included free super saver shipping I placed my order right away. When I got home from work today the Amazon box was waiting for me - Woo-Hoo! my new hair dryer! - I opened the box and instantly knew that what I was seeing was not what I had ordered. It was made by Conair, was the same color, had the same attachments and had the same model number on the bottom of the box but it was called the Conair You Reel (see the picture I posted above). I called Conair to find out if they had changed the name and packaging of this hair dryer. I was told by the Conair Customer Service Department that You Reel is a subsidiary of Conair and although it is covered by the same warranty as the Infinti it is NOT the Infiniti. I called Amazon customer service and as always they were very friendly and offered to either send me another hair dryer or refund my money. Since I haven't even plugged the hair dyrer in yet I wanted to try it before deciding to return/refund it. I have had several Conair hair dryers through the years and I'm sure this one will be just fine (I will update this review after I use it a few times). I've never had any problem when ordering from Amazon and will continue to do so but I just wanted to warn other people looking at this hair dryer that in this case what you see is not what you get."	12/20/2011

There are not many wall mount hair dryers to pick from, and I mostly liked this one while it worked.  BRIGHT night light (can be good or bad.. I liked it), nice physical design, and decent power.  I thought the air volume still did not compete with most $15 standard dryers, but if you are not looking for big air volume, it is fine. My wife misses a cold button.  So in all, a mediocre hair dryer but with great wall mount convenience and bright night light.  Now with the issues... Bought 18 months ago, worked fine except overheated very easily. If used on HIGH, it would run as long as you want till you shut it off, then the internal temperature would apparently overheat with no more airflow, and would refuse to turn back on for 5 minutes or so.  Annoying, but I got used to it by going to medium heat for about 10 seconds before shutting it off every time.  That seemed to cool it down just enough not to trigger the temperature limiter in case I needed to turn it back on right away.  I probably would have pitched it, but I liked the wall mount convenience and put 4 holes in my wall to mount it.  Well, here we are 18 months of life, and now it is completely dead. Night light on but the hair dryer is not home. I am electrically capable and could probably open up and fix this thing, but it is not worth the safety concern.  If you want to pay a premium for wall mount, just know you might only get a year or two out of it.. others seems to have similar experiences.  Sad that the $10 hand held models seem to last much longer.  Anyway, to cover up the holes in the walls, I am trying one of the other few wall mount options out there by another manufacturer. If this one dies, I am giving up on wall mount.  Good luck... hair dryers should not take this much thought."	7/18/2011

This is what sold me on this unit to begin with. My only problem with the unit is the slide buttons.  They are not raised, so it is harder to control the heat settings and also shut on and off.

From the very first day she used this thing, she started getting compliments about her hair. Her hair is normally pretty straight and flat, and it definitely had more body.  It was also less frizzy after she got done drying it for whatever that's worth. The compliments are fading now that her coworkers are used to the new look, but my wife is still raving about it.<br /><br />I purchased this for her because I got tired of repairing or replacing all of the crappy ones she bought over the years. The latest one I put to rest dimmed all of the lights in the house when it was coming online. She and I needed a change. I read all of the good reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere, and gave it a shot.<br /><br />The Elchim is everything I hoped for in a hairdryer. The first thing my wife and I both noticed was that it was MUCH quieter than any hair dryer she had ever used. Its highest setting is equivalent to most hair dryers' lowest setting.  We can actually hold a conversation now if we need to while she dries her hair. I figured it was up to my wife to protect her own hearing, but I was very concerned when she dried my daughter's hair.  It definitely defeats the myth that louder is better or more powerful.<br /><br />Secondly, the quieter airflow was very powerful. 1500 liters/minute is the claim. I haven't ever seen another volume measurement, but it sounds impressive, right? Anyway, as others have stated, my wife dried her hair in about half of the time that it took her normally. She thought I was nuts when I showed it to her and it did not sound like a fighter jet, but she was pleasantly surprised. It has a removable filter screen (twist-off) on the end to keep the airflow at its peak which will prove invaluable over time. The buildup of hairspray, makeup, lint, and whatever else will be easy to remove without completely disassembling it. This congealed mess has contributed to the deaths of other hair dryers in the past.<br /><br />Elchim is a professional brand and they build their products for heavy-duty use. It has a thick round cord, which will be much less prone to tangling. It is smaller than almost every full size hair dryer she has owned.  It has a sleek design as opposed to the ones with the cylinder sticking out the side to house the motor. This will prove great for packing. I expect it to last for years.<br /><br />I read many mixed reviews about the ionic dryers, Tourmaline, ceramic heating elements, EMF, etc., but none swayed me away from common sense. See below:<br /><br />The ionic dryers are supposed to trap moisture in your hair. A few things on that: Moisture = weight. Weight = flat. Conditioners are still the best thing to protect your hair and give it shine without weighing it down. Many use wax, which is much lighter than water and gives body and shine without weighing the hair down.<br /><br />There are also claims about breaking down the water molecules to smaller sizes. Science note: Breaking down a molecule of water (H2O) leaves hydrogen peroxide (HO) and a free hydrogen atom (H). We now have that answer for fuel cell cars and bleach blondes, right? Ionic dryers don't heat the air, they heat the hair from within. Isn't that what microwaves do? There are good Ionic dryers out there, but be wary of the claims. Some people claim that ionic dryers also cause dry eyes and headaches. I did not see a need to risk anything like that.<br /><br />Last thing about ionic dryers, the cheaper ones use technology in which the ionizer does not last. A good ionic dryer will cost you more than the $29.95 delivered! versions. Read the reviews, none of the 5-star reviews for the cheaper ones is after extended use. Many of the lowest reviews complain about inconsistency, lack of performance, and breaking down altogether. If you want a good ionic dryer, be prepared to spend a little. If the cheapies were the answer, they would be in use in the salons.<br /><br />Bottom line: Your hearing matters; protect it.  Proven technology matters; ignore the hype about trapping moisture in the hair you are trying to dry. Ergonomics matter; pack-ability, weight, and hand comfort might make or break you on how you feel about your hair dryer. My wife's arrived in all black...so what. She never paraded one around in the past, and I don't expect her to anytime soon. They only make black, white, red, and red-black, no neon or orange surprises. There is no substitute for quality and durability. While you may not always get what you pay for, if you buy cheap things, the adage holds true.<br /><br />I researched these things thoroughly before I bought it and read several reviews where people were using their Elchim hair dryers for 10+ years. I have no doubt that this will follow those lines. Salons around the world use them several hours per day. Ours should last for years. Well worth the $60-ish I paid.<br /><br />*** Update - Feb 20, 2010 ***<br /><br />After about two years and NO abuse, the cord on my wife's hairdryer crapped the bed. What is weird is that it broke about three inches down from the rubber protector that goes into the handle. I expected any break would be at a bend where the protector ends or inside of the hairdryer where it is internally clamped. It broke where it should have never been an issue. I cut the cord about two inches from the solder points, where I thought the break would be, intending to solder back on. As it turned out, the intermittent wiring was about three to four inches further down from my original cut. When I dissected the failed portion, it looked like it had been accidentally crimped or kinked in the manufacturing process. I still hold that the hairdryer is top-notch. I will repair the cord on the next one I get, if I get the same model. Why do I need another one? Read on.<br /><br />For the guys out there saying no biggy, I can fix a cord, beware. For the record, this thing is a BEAST to disassemble and reassemble. Iwork with all sorts of electronics. When it originally failed, I opened up the hairdryer thinking the electrical problem was internal. Once I was inside, I saw the problem was not there. However, there were two wires in there that broke with little maneuvering and prove near impossible to repair. After reassembling the hairdryer, I could not get the screws seated well enough to feel safe when in the hands of my wife or daughter. I threw it out after MUCH frustration and solder. It did work when I got it back together, but the exposed screws in a wet environment caused me concern.<br /><br />I regret doing this because I was the person that posted the pictures of the cord and how it would never break. Alas, I was wrong. I think I will look for a newer/different model by the same manufacturer. I DID NOT contact Elchim to see how much a repair was. After shipping both ways, I'm sure it would have been up there with the cost of the dryer itself. I did email them a detailed description of the failure though. Nobody has replied to that letter. My wife hates the replacement dryer(tourmaline) and wants her Elchim back.<br /><br />For all those that I doubted: I'm stupid. You're smart. I was wrong. You were right. You're the best. I'm the worst. You're very good looking. I'm not attractive. (from Happy Gilmore) I thought about posting pictures of my failure, but what's the point. I edited a picture previously posted noting where the item eventually broke. Good electrician, possibly a good deal. I would change my star rating, but it would remove my review from the most helpful spot. If you read this far, you must have felt it was helpful too....or at least amusing?<br /><br />*** Update - December 2013 ***<br /><br />When the last one died (my fault) three years back, I didn't replace it because she had purchased a cheap stand-in while I wrongfully attempted to fix the cord. She simply kept using it after I killed the Elchim. I put up with screaming our morning conversations for longer than I should have waiting for the cheap jet engine to die. Well, it lives on, but my patience broke. I reluctantly coughed up the money for a new Elchim. Same model, just different color. OMG, it's so much nicer to not have to listen to that screaming menace in the morning. We can actually talk to each other if necessary while she dries her hair. She'll probably appreciate life more once she can heard birds singing again. I felt a bit stupid after I killed the first one, and I didn't want to augment that feeling by spending $$$ for a hair dryer when she already had a replacement. Now that I swallowed my pride and replaced the Elchim, everyone's happier...and I'm sure we hear a little better too."	3/27/2008

I've been blow-drying my hair for years and have never had to stop because my scalp felt like it was burning.  And, despite the technology it doesn't appear to dry my hair any faster than the old dryer I replaced.  One thing I noticed about the reviews of the dryer was that many people who purchase (and love) this have long hair.  I do not so I'm always drying right around my scalp.

The size and power are great.     Con: The screw head like button that you turn to change voltage is down right impossible for an average female to operate. I had trouble at home turning the button with a coin as recommended by the tech support people when I called for assistance. I finally had to use a screw driver! Now I leave the setting set for European voltage and just use it for foreign travel.	7/3/2008

Overall I am satisfied with the dryer itself. The built-in nightlight I thought would help me save from taking up another outlet for a separate nightlight. However, the nightlight stopped working after only about 5 days. It still comes on occasionally (when it feels like it). When it is on, it is very bright. One other improvement I would like to see is where it plugs into the wall. I would like to see a 90 degree plug so that the cord does not stick out so far from the wall. For my particluar bathroom setup, the cord sticking out gets in my way. Not bad for the price though."	2/20/2008

I just purchased 2 more of these eye shadow palettes (one for me & another for her) & will continue to buy them! The palette came wrapped tight in bubble wrap & all 88 shades were in perfect condition! I also love the way they are packaged, slim enough to throw in your purse but large enough when you open it that you can easily use the inside mirror to put on the eye shadow, and talk about color options, WOW! They are very vibrant, beautiful colors. It would also make a great affordable gift for anyone you know who loves to have fun with eye shadow!"	8/5/2010

She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene. Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself. I would totally recommend this to anyone who cannot afford one of the high end electric toothbrushes with a sensitive mode."	8/5/2010

However, the dryer is very hot which seems to make using my flat iron take longer since the hair seems to have already been heat-styled into a specific position (pouf) with the dryer - my old dryer didn't provide such an effect.

They don't take up space on your bathroom counter, you don't have to wrap the cord around and around your hair dryer (which can eventually lead to internal wire damage), and you don't have to find a separate place to store it.  I never thought of actually owning one in my own home until I visited my sister a few years ago, and she had this one mounted on her guest bathroom wall.  It worked great, and I knew right then that I needed one of these.  I wrote down the model number and went online to buy one as soon as I returned home.  My husband was more than happy to install this (a couple of screws) since it meant no more hair dryers laying on the bathroom sink.  We both liked it so much that he even suggested that I go ahead and buy another one and have it on hand for when the first one wore out.

You have to go slowly and gently with the switch control in order to get any setting other than off or the highest heat/fan position.

Unfortunetly I bought them because of the lights and thought they would look high end in my barbershop but instead made my shop look bad when I mounted them and one after another the lights started blowing out.  another issue is that I have personaly noticed is that the breaker triggers quite often if I use another item off the other socket.  Definetly, definetly not worth the price tag at all.  You can buy other blowers without the light for way way cheaper so your really paying for the extra light feature which doesnt work anyway."	2/8/2012

Instead I contacted the US Consumer Product Safety Commission via email and I received a phonecall from them.  They sent an agent out to my home, purchased this dangerous dryer for cash, took pictures of all the burnt hair (yes, I saved all evidence) and I expect as there are many complaints about this product they will soon recall it.

"**Review about BLACK CHROME version.**<br /><br />It's always a pain buying a new hair dryer--you're used to the one you had, annoyances and all, and it's a crap shoot as to whether or not you'll like the one you've bought sight unseen (although you've read the reviews and are hopeful).<br /><br />I wanted to love this hair dryer, but overall I just didn't.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that it is HEAVY. Well, not a bag of flour heavy, but it certainly has a definite heft to it (heavier than I was used to, at least) and for someone who needs to spend a good 30 constant minutes holding it and moving it around...it was heavier than I'd prefer.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed is that the cord is REALLY long. I never gave much thought to cord length, but it is advertised as 10 feet and I'm sure it is. I can't say as if I ever need a cord that long--in all my years using a hair dryer, I think a 3' cord would be plenty.<br /><br />The third thing I noticed was that the attachments are metal--which at first I thought was a bonus because it meant they would be sturdier. That said, since they are metal, they get HOT during use! Surprise, I know, right? Hee. But when you're used to plastic and suddenly have metal and you forget and grab the end...OUCH! Also, the attachments were a bit of a pain to put on. I had to fight with one of them because it didn't seem to want to click on easily (or at least as easily as any dryer I'd used before). I did finally get it on, and thought Well, at least it will STAY on. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case with the resin pick attachment, which, in addition to being super awkward to use, came flying off the end in about seven seconds. The other concentrator attachments were fine, but that pick one was useless.<br /><br />The fourth thing I noticed is that the button placement SUCKS. I managed to turn it off at least 10 times in the first two minutes of using it. SOOOOO frustrating. Just grabbing the handle to hold it would bump it to OFF. GRRRRR. I tried to be especially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.<br /><br />The fifth and final thing I noticed is that the hot is REALLY SUPER HOT. I mean, so hot that you do have to really be careful how long you point it at your scalp--and I'd NEVER use it on my hair without putting some form of styling protectant on it first.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration, this was NOT the hair dryer for me. AT ALL. It was too heavy (minus one star), had hard-to-attach and useless attachments (minus one star), and had sucky button placement (minus one star). It's going back.ially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.

After my 20+ year old Conair blow dryer was literally falling apart (but still working!), I decided it was time to treat myself to a new blow dryer a couple of weeks ago.  I have very thick, long, wavy hair that I usually let dry naturally after drying my bangs (maybe 5 minutes).  Yesterday I thought it would be nice to dry the whole mess and use the iron on it- something I may do once a month because of the time and effort it takes.   I kick it up to the high setting and become aware of a hot smell after a couple of minutes, but think that since I don't use this setting very often, it's just using coils it doesn't usually use- wrong!  Soon it pops, hisses, and glows a nice yellow-red color before shutting off.  I then realize that even the grip is hot and that the snake of smoke coming out of the end of the blow dryer is a death knell for my brand new device!  I hope that maybe it'll work again after cooling off, much to my husband's amusement who said that smell only comes with electronic death, but no, it's forever dead."	4/22/2007

The features I like about the Andis hair dryers I've used were that they were not too large or heavy, they had medium heat to medium-high heat, they didn't blow too hard, and they were relatively quite.  I've used some hair dryers that almost gave me wrist strain trying to hold them, and some that caused your ears to ring once your hair was dry.  The Andis' hangup models seem to find a good compromise between function and low noise levels. I've put these in all our bathrooms at home, since they can be used without disturbing others in the house even if they are sleeping.  Some different models of Andis dryers I've owned before would stop working after about a year due to a diode on the on/off switch overheating and failing, but this model doesn't seem to have that issue.  Other nice features that this 30975/HD-10L has are that there is no GFI transformer plug at the end of the cord...It's built into the base housing of the dryer.  Also, this unit comes with a cord hang-up bracket which can be placed on either side of the base. Like other hair dryers the on/off switch will reset to the off position when it's placed back into the base wall holder. Taking the dryer out of the base again will resume the flow of warm air. Some reviewers have complained of the brightness of the built-in nightlight. It's not annoying to me and it can be use it as the only nightlight in the bathroom. If I could ask for only one additional feature, it would be a way to change the color of the LED light.  There are many LED nightlights on the market that let you select what color you'd like the light to have, and lock it to that color.  This would be a nice feature to have on this unit, and might please those that think the light is too bright.  Last, this unit has a metal wall bracket and paper template, so it's actually very easy to install. The plastic base then screws to the metal plate, once mounted, with two small screws hidden by the hair dryer when it's in the base. Any excess cord can be hidden inside the base, so between not having an unsightly GFI box on the plug end and the fact that you can shorten the cord to just a few inches, if needed, makes for a very clean installation. No cords unsightly tangled cords hanging around your bath to get caught on other stuff.  And not having the GFI plug allows other appliances like cordless tooth brushes, shavers, or rollers to be used on the same wall outlet without the adjacent plug(s) being blocked.ted, with two small screws hidden by the hair dryer when it's in the base.

The cool button and cool heat function are ACTUALLY cool. Most hairdryers take time to cool down, so going from hot to cold doesn't work. However, on this hairdryer, if you want to go straight from hot to cool, it happens in seconds. maybe it's just because it has cooled down here in san diego but I can't really definitively determine that.

This dryer makes 70% less noise & drys their hair in way way less than half the time. The air velocity & heat is not matched by anything out there. Trust me I have bought them all, looking for some peace & quiet in the morning. The velocity alone is triple that of any I have ever seen and the fact that at this air output you can still melt plastic (within 1 inch). They drop this thing every day, yes I hear it even over the use noise and it take a beating. I love this hair dryer even though I used it only 1 time (it dried my short/medium length hair in less than 1.5 minutes.

Thought I would try this Ionic dryer. I've used it for about 3 wks now & have noticed no improvements to my hair. My hair is always shiny, so who can say? But as for frizzies or static hair, I have some issues & they were not improved by using this dryer. As others have said the buttons are a challenge to not press when using. You have to hold it by the sides only. Also the high speed is not much different from the low & neither blow that much air compared to my last dryer & many others I have had.

The Remington didn't last me long (less than a year) and in general was a mediocre hair dryer but it got the job done.<br /><br />I'll start with the cons: I have thick long straight hair with a natural wave, my day to day hair style is scrunched. I have a universal diffuser that I love to use, it's huge and has high sides that are easy to scoop my long hair into. Unfortunately the first thing I noticed about the John Frieda Hair Dryer is the unusual shape of the nozzle. It is big and short and my universal diffuser does not fit it, nor will any universal diffuser on the market (at least I haven't found one yet). So I'm forced to use the attached diffuser that came with it. It does the job but it's not as easy to use as my old one. The buttons are also in a very awkward place, right where my thumb sits when I'm holding it so I'm constantly turning the temperature down by accident. I also end up hitting the cool shot button all the time. It takes some adjustment to get used to.<br /><br />Otherwise, this hair dryer is excellent, it's extremely powerful. It has cut my hair drying time down by half. Most of the time I don't even use it on full heat. If you don't use a diffuser or aren't married to using a larger universal one, I would definitely recommend this hair dryer. If it wasn't so awesome, I would probably return it for not fitting my diffuser but I think using the included one will be an okay compromise for me."	12/3/2011

I was worried that I wouldn't be able to recreate my perfect brows at home, but- this kit was soo easy to use. I just used the stencil, and the brow powder, and viola my brows looked great again, and most importantly- natural. Sometimes I've used brow products that looked unnatural- but this stuff is of great quality. I would definately recommend it. It may seem pricey- but it is worth it.

I should know because I've had 4 of them.  I keep buying them on average 1/18mos.  This IS NOT good.  The systemic problem with them is that the cord breaks a wire internally right near the top just below the rubber protector. I'm thinking the rubber protector may just be the problem. This has happened to me on all 4 Elchims I have purchased. My hair stylist confirms what I have found. He said that he constantly has to repair the cords on Elchims.

"I purchased this hair dryer to replace my Super Solano that died after more than a decade.  I loved the Solano, but I wanted to see if a significantly less expensive dryer would work as well.  The good news is, it dries just fine.  The bad news is that the concentrator attachment (there are three attachments - I use the narrow concentrator every day for straightening) is unnecessarily difficult to attach.  For the first couple of months, it took a great deal of effort and force to get the concentrator nozzle attached.  I had to twist and turn and manuever it every which way.  Even when I managed to get it on, it was easy to knock it off during the course of drying my hair.  I had to wait a minute or two to reattach it because the nozzle was too hot to handle.  When it cooled down sufficiently, the twisting and turning began anew.  When this happened numerous times during one attempt to dry my hair, it got pretty frustrating.<br />As others have noted, the thin chrome finish of the dryer chips off very easily, particularly when using the attachments.  After having owned this for about two months, the chrome is completely chipped off (the dryer has a matte black finish underneath the chrome) where the concentrator attaches.  It doesn't look great, but I don't have to worry anymore about brushing chrome flakes off my clothes every morning.<br />Over the past week, it's gotten much easier to get the concentrator attached, and it's less prone to fall off.  I assume it just took a couple of months to stretch.<br /><br />Update 11/9/10: The attachment no longer will stay on the dryer.  I'm reducing the rating to two stars, because without the attachment, this dryer is worthless to me."	8/19/2010

I had tried my razor with the factory Merkur blade, and I got a half-decent shave, but I had to be very careful because the blade would randomly dig into my skin. I switched to Derby, and what a difference a Derby makes.<br /><br />The blades are very sharp- my wife tested them gently dry-shaving a bit of leg hair, and they left an instant bald spot. However, they're not too sharp as some people have said a Feather blade can be- I can even press down on my razor just a bit in trouble areas to get really close results, and not have to worry too much about slicing myself open.<br /><br />If you're just starting out with double edge shaving, do yourself a favor and pick up some Derby blades. The only reason I'll consider switching potentially to find a razor with more economical packaging. Derby blades come in little plastic mini-tubs that are individually wrapped, not to mention the blades are also individually wrapped. I would prefer to be a touch more environmentally conscious and get a paper sleeve full of razors instead of six plastic boxes.<br /><br />When packaging is your biggest concern about a product, you know there's good product in there. Recommended for beginning shavers, or anyone looking for a good workhorse blade."	8/5/2010

When my old Hartman Protech 1600 hair dryer hit the bathroom floor, things weren't the same. Eventually, in a spectacular pyrotechnic display, it breathed its last.<br />Since I had paid 20 bucks for it way back when, I was ready to spend that much on a replacement. Much to my surprise, in the 10 or so years I'd owned that dryer, a lot had changed, and now the same money buys a lot more hair dryer, so with some dough to spare, I bought one of these.<br />Many complain that it doesn't pack the same wallop as other dryers but that's a case of perception versus reality. The Conair's barrel has a larger diameter than most dryers and its fan is quieter, so while the perceptible breeze isn't as blustery, it's still moving plenty of air. I know because I use an egg timer to count off 3 minutes while I dry my hair and the Conair never leaves my hair damp (a barber told me that after 3 minutes of blow drying, you're just toasting your hair and not helping it). If you MUST have that scalp-scorching pinpoint blast, Conair includes a concentrator.<br />Ions are all the rage in hair dryer technology right now. Purportedly, a stream of ions directed at your hair will neutralize static electricity and smooth out frizzy hair. Ions are also claimed to flatten out scaly hair shafts, resulting in more shine. I'm waiting for our good friends at Consumer Reports to weigh in on the benefits (or lack thereof) of dual ion ports, but after a week of daily use with the ion switch ON, I've noticed that my hair doesn't fight me as much when I brush it into place. Even when the static-charged Santa Ana winds are howling through sunny SoCal, my hair doesn't stick out like porcupine quills. And, yes, if I turn my head from side to side, there's a noticeable shimmer that either wasn't there before or I had never noticed it.<br />A minor flaw is that the power and ion switches respond to a very light push, but after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer. The dryer offers low and high air-speed/heat settings and has a cool shot button that cuts off the heater while cranking the fan up to its fastest speed. Cool shot is another feature that is said to set a style in place by cooling down the hair quickly.<br />So, whether ions really do or don't make a difference, the overall performance of the Conair Ion Shine is worth the price.ut after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer.

They are usually not strong enough, or too hot, or not hot enough, or cheaply made (even expensive ones), etc.  I have thick long hair and it takes forever to dry.  This dryer is amazing.  It has several settings and on the hottest, strongest setting I can dry my hair faster than any other dryer I've had.  But it doesn't get overly hot either.  I don't feel like I'm burning my hair and scalp as I have with other dryers.  As someone who has been on the hunt for the perfect dryer for decades, I feel like I finally found one.

Well, if you use the high air mode, the noise is quite loud but much tolerable than other products I have used. Basically I just used the low air mode since the noise is low and it isn't too hot.     Furthermore, when you first use this product, it will have a burning metal smell (like soldering smell). However, after 3-4 times of use the smell will be gone. The smell won't stick on your hair though, so it isn't a big deal. This hair dryer is light which I think is a plus."	3/14/2011

This is very annoying and you have to get used to not pressing this button.    Second:  in order to turn on /off the dryer and turn the setting to how you want, you have to get used to doing it from an awkward position in the back of the handle where your fingers are holding the dryer.

For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I've got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn't benefit from a strong airflow.  Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don't have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  That doesn't happen with this Vidal Sassoon model.  The oval-shaped barrel seems to also help concentrate the airflow.      I also like the fact that this dryer has three heat settings and two speed settings which can be selected independently.  With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  So as a rule, I use the dryer with the ion setting in the off position except when drying the ends of my shoulder-length hair.  Probably someone with thick, coarse hair wouldn't have this issue.         I've had this dryer for only about 5 weeks, so it's too early to comment on whether it's built to last - I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  This model might not be just right for every head of hair, but for mine, it's perfect.  I hope Vidal Sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time."	3/2/2011

I purchased this dryer with the intent to improve the condition.  It does a FAIR job. I have had the dryer about 2 years and it hold up rather well considering the abuse I give it.  The dryer has very little power and I would say that drying time probably takes about 2-3 minutes longer than with a regular blow dryer.  If you have very frizzy or curly hair then you I probably would NOT recommend this just based on the power levels.  If you have wavy hair then this dryer in combination with either a diffuser or the accompanying attachment should would well for you.  It is a heavier hair dryer and isn't great to take on vacations.  The position of the ion switch is lousy - you'll probably find yourself accidentally turning it off just based on it's location.  Settings are either high or low and the same goes for speed.  I happen to use high but if you like variety you may want to consider another model.  A better buy is the Revlon Ion dryer if you feel like upgrading.  The difference in price is perhaps 5 U.S. dollars at best...."	8/11/2005

"I have been a long time user and fan of the Conair Cord Keeper hairdryers.  I use them until they just die.  Recently Conair changed the look of this hairdryer and at first sight I thought that it felt much more flimsy than my previous Cord Keepers but did not give it much thought since I have always been very pleased with this hairdryer.  The hairdryer lasted about 2 weeks before the folding handle cracked.  When we opened up the handle we found that the plastic piece that makes the handle fold was cracked in half and did not appear repairable.  I went out and purchased another Cord Keeper thinking that I just had a 'lemon', well the second one lasted exactly 3 months and 1 day.  Today I pulled out the hairdryer, opened the handle and heard a crack.  This handle is also broken which prevents the hairdryer from staying in the open position. The product does have a 2 yr warranty but you are required to ship the defective product to a Conair service center along with $3 for shipping and handling - this would cost me more than the hairdryer, just not worth my time to box it up and take it to the post office!<br /><br />That being said, when this hairdryer worked it was wonderful.  The two speed settings are the perfect speeds, the hairdryer is extremely light and the handle is easy to grip.  The retractable cord is the best feature of this hairdryer and along with the folding handle it is great for travel.<br /><br />I did write to Conair and their response will determine if I purchase another Conair hairdryer plus I will be back to update this review."	1/23/2006

The ends of her hair that stick out of the bottom take a little longer but it's worth it.  I'm thinking of trying it out...

I do not recommend Revlon hair dryers and will not purchase one again.  -----  Added on Oct 13, 2011:  Well, once it started showing overheating problems that I recognized from previous Revlon dryer, I went ahead and ordered an Andis 1600 watt which is also a very low price but pretty strong hair dryer. My previous Andis worked for several years with no problem and I loved it before it conked out on me and I would have ordered another but it was out of stock at the time, so I ordered the Revlon instead. Sigh. So, one month later I am tossing the Revlon and fortunately the Andis is back in stock now and arrived two days before my Revlon popped loudly and frizzled and fried and died an ignominious death this evening. So I had a back up in place. Thank you Andis! I will not be buying anything but Andis hair dryers from now on. The Revlon is not worth buying IMO."	10/10/2011

"I bought this hair dryer after doing a ton of research and thought it would be a good investment.  When I first started using it, it worked great.  I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair and how shiny it looked afterwards.  I have naturally curly hair and prefer it straight so I used this to dry it straight (along with a round brush) and it did the job amazingly well.<br /><br />Well I had this for a little over a year when all of a sudden one day it started shooting out some sparks.  I couldn't believe it.  I turned it on another day just to see if it even turned on and it did but you could see the coils in it started to get red and then shoot out some sparks.  This wasn't even overused or anything.  In fact since I was pregnant at the time I bought it, I had a hard time standing up for too long so I only used it once or twice a week.  After that little use it was already not working properly in just over a year.  In fact, for about 4 months out of that first year, I didn't even use it right after I had my son.  That was way too short of a time and too much money spent on an item that wasn't working properly.<br /><br />I am very diasspointed with this and will NEVER buy anything by this company ever again.<br /><br />If you need a good hairdryer, look elsewhere.  I'm just glad and lucky that the sparks didn't land on my hair and cause a fire or anything."	1/22/2008

"I've been using the Sonicare for many, many years, probably 15 years, when they first came out.  I have the Advance handle and Philips no longer makes replacement heads for the Advance handles but instead has a slightly different head called e-series that is supposed to fit the Advance handle.  I ordered the three pack of the e-series and it does fit the original Advance handle but be advised that he makes a louder noise when in use.  Apparently, the magnets on the e-series' don't match what was originally designed for the Advance handles.  I called Philips and demonstrated the noise difference over the phone to the technician and even she could tell the significant difference in noise.  It's not unbareable by any stretch but is not as comfortable as using the old replacement heads.  The technician did not know about the difference in noise, checked with others and then got back to me that, yes, there is a difference in noise.  Philips should tell the user about this difference.  It's no big deal, but should be disclosed.<br /><br />What I found interesting also is that the new package says to replace the heads every 3 months.  The old packaging said every 6 months.  When I asked the technician about this and asked if this meant that the new heads were not made as well as the old heads and was this part of the American corporate conspiracy to have consumers buy more and spend more, she said they changed the recommendation on the advice of dental professionals.  Whether these dental professionals are part of the conspiracy, I do not know.  Whether the new heads are not as well built as the old, I also don't know.  But in any event, since I've been using the Sonicare for the past 15 years or so I've changed heads every six months or so and my teeth have not fallen out and I've had no complaints from my dentist.  I guess I'll update this review four months from now and advise whether my teeth have fallen out and are full of cavities all because I didn't change the replacement head after three months.<br /><br />But to Philips credit, at least they didn't simply stop making a head to fit the Advance handle and thereby force the consumer to buy a new handle for the new heads.  The e-series does fit, albeit not perfectly.<br /><br />Stay tuned.e replacement head after three months.

I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break so I can get by until a good one arrives. This is a good one, and what a difference! I'm so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would've been toast! I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems. The only problem was on my end. When the unit arrived, I thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it. I had to get some more from a local craft store so DO NOT REMOVE THAT TAPE!! My bad.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a professional but I don't want charbroiled hair either. I'm pretty confident that won't happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use. I'm fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren't bad at all; that's after she reprimands me for not coming in but every 6 to 9 months.<br /><br />I ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.<br /><br />I even used the Elevate on my dog today without issue. Of course it helps that I used to groom dogs so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/her.<br /><br />Addendum 03/15/2012<br />I've noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on/off switch and utilizing the pik attachment. It takes some getting used to in order to hold the dryer and feed your hair through the pik. I had a difficult time at first as well. I can't describe the way I do it (I'm not even sure I'm doing it correctly). I can only say that once I got used to it, it was easy to use the pik and NOT shut the dryer off."	1/30/2012

"I spent several weeks researching hair dryers before making this purchase.  This dryer was recommended to me by my hair stylist.  I have very thick hair with a slight wave (just enough to be annoying - not completely straight or curly) and was looking for a dryer that would cut down on frizz and dry time and just plain make it easier to dry my hair - this has done it all.  It is also very lightweight and much quieter than my previous Conair dryer.  Now to be honest, this is the first expensive dryer I have ever purchased so I can't personally compare it to others out there on the market, but I read every review I could get my hands on before buying and I didn't see any negatives where other expensive dryers (T3 for instance) seemed to have just as many unhappy customers as happy ones.  Even though it was quite expensive I don't regret it one bit.  And, even though FHI won't honor their warranty if you buy it from Amazon, Amazon will honor the manufacturer's warranty.

That is one or two steps up from non-drying. At least you don't feel your lips tightening throught the day. They are comfortable. The trick is to pat it in. Your lipstick or gloss will really stay. Watch out for the one problem with all primers; they are beige. Your lips aren't. I didn't like the look of glosses, because you are supposed to see the lip through them. You might want to put a bit of lipstick on before your gloss. But your lipsticks will absolutely be the color they are in the tube. No more problems with the ones that turn color on their own. You are free to pick out the color you like. And all lipsticks will look smoother than ever and stay on. And really truly, no feathering or bleeding. I don't even try the others any more. I do put it in my purse for after lunch. That is the only time during the day that I wear it off. For the rest of the day you may have to reapply lipstick mid-morning or mid-afternoon, depending on how much talking you have done, but the price of the primer is worth it 1. because it works and 2. your lipcolor is going to last a lot longer."	4/15/2007

"I purchased this peel because I wanted something that might help to fade any small freckles/sun spots developing on my face, as well as fade small wrinkles near my eyes. I am Asian, with a medium-light complexion that is already fairly wrinkle and acne-free; but I was starting to see more melanin spots on my face developing, as I didn't start using sunscreen on my face daily until age 30 (I am now 35). However, my skin does tend to be oily in the T-zone, and I would still get an occasional pimple on my forehead or under my cheekbones on a regular basis.     After using this product, I noticed that my already scarce breakouts became practically non-existent, and though some of the small freckles on my upper cheeks haven't faded much, my skin does feel and look smoother and clearer. I don't use concealer, powder, or foundation (I can't stand the look and feel of it on my skin), and only use Shiseido SPF 55 for the face on a daily basis, but this seems to be all I need to still look pretty flawless, which I attribute to some of the peel's effects. I originally only used the 35% glycolic acid peel sold by the same company, but decided to try this lactic acid/glycolic acid combination to see if it would have a different or stronger effect (it does sting/tingle more than the 35% glycolic acid peel alone). I usually use this product every 7 days, and leave the solution on for a full 10 minutes (it stings and tingles, but this doesn't bother me much; leaving it on this long doesn't cause any hot spots on my skin, either, but my skin is pretty resistant to a lot of environmental insults). I also notice that small blackheads and sebaceous plugs in my forehead and nose will loosen easily and can be pushed or exfoliated out more easily after using this peel.     Overall, I think this is a good maintenance peel for those who want to slow (or possibly even reverse) the subtle signs of aging, i.e. development of melanin pigmentation from sun exposure, smoothing the surface of the epidermis, possibly neutralizing fine lines, and decreasing acne. I will likely continue using this product, until I become adventurous enough to perhaps try something different and stronger (i.e. a 70% Lactic Acid peel). The price is right, too, and won't cost you the overhead you might pay for having the same type of peel done at a medi-spa."	8/5/2010

It is not the identical model to the current one, as it only has 1600 watts vs. 2000 watts for the current one.  But, look at it this way, you could buy 3 of these for the same price as the one from an authorized dealer with a warranty-and you would still have to pay $15+ to have it fixed if it breaks under the warranty.  The one we got came with no serial number as described in other reviews below, but it has been working extremely well and as advertised in that it dries hair significantly faster than our old Conair Yellowbird 2000 watt and leaves your hair feeling much softer.  I'd rather pay $100 with no warranty than $300 with one (that's like spending $200 on an extended warranty)."	3/6/2009

I have just used it overseas and I am thrilled that both the low and high settings work on the 240V setting (every other dual-voltage hair dryer I've had in the past only worked on the low setting overseas).    This hair dryer is excellent because it is lightweight and dries my hair very quickly with much less frizz than ordinary hair dryers. I also purchased the T3 Tourmaline Diffuser and love it because I have naturally wavy hair and it leaves my hair with nice waves, much less frizz and it does not feel crunchy and dry at the ends - just nice soft waves.  I can't say that it leaves my hair completely frizz free but definitely softer.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer."	9/17/2007

Beauty	5	3	4	N	Y	Improved design - more stylish than the old model	I bought 3 Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hairdryer back in 2000 and had used them since. After a few years' use I noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt. I found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture. So based on the durability of the product I bought this model again expecting Bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation. My previous 3 dryer are still working but I changed them all anyway.<br />I'm impressed with the new design - it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when I hold the blow hole by hand it's just mildly warm - not hot at all. It is not a very quiet hairdryer but I'm happy with the purchase. I expect to last 20 years.	8/21/2012

After this review I decided to contact the Remington online customer service and sent them a message with my complaint.  Shortly thereafter I received an email from them asking me to return the broken one and they would send a replacement.  They sent the shipping box and the label as well and within 10 days I had a new dryer that I have been using since with no problems.  Granted it has only been a month but I was very impressed with Remington.  I just hope that no one there was injured when testing the dryer (lol)... it really did blow flames.  Obviously there was a short which could happen with any electrical product but it was the way that the company responded that I had to give the rating of 4 stars when previously I only give it 1.  I really do like this dryer and how my hair looks and feels afterwards which is very different from other dryers that are no ionic.  Plus it dries my hair super fast without drying it out.<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:  Bought this dryer 4 months ago even though I read the bad reviews as well as the good ones and was concerned but figured it was a good brand name. i only use a hair dryer at most 2x/wk. Last night I was using the dryer on my wet hair and flames and sparks started shooting out of it!!! Thank God my hair was wet and didn't have any flammable product in it. I showed it to my boyfriend who suggested that I contact consumer affairs for Remington, which I just did. Since it has been over 30 days I can no longer return the appliance to Amazon. I have had many hair dryers and most of the time they have just worn out after a year or 2 but this was just scary.<br /><br />1/18/13 - Almost 1 year later... and still working perfectly.  In fact, I bought another dryer in the interim, waiting for the new Remington and paid a pretty penny for the new one.  I used both multiple times, trading off one for the other. I found that I prefer the Remington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?). It drys my hair better and more evenly.mington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?).

"The Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer is a great little personal grooming appliance.  It has two settings: Low and High.  I use High almost exclusively, even though I have fine, short, grey hair because I don't like to dawdle over grooming in the morning.  Its dual voltage selections (125V/250V) would come in handy if travelling (with an added plug adapter).  High produces a rapid stream of air that quickly heats up and stays at a steady, moderately high temperature.  Low is appropriate if you spend more time styling with some degree of heat--producing a nice smooth and fuller result.  However, I'm a Type-A character who wants the job done pronto, so this is my machine of choice.  All dryers sound a little loud right in your own ear, but a family member says that the Andis is quieter than the Sunbeam I recently replaced.<br /><br />I bought this device to replace a Sunbeam compact dryer, which replaced another Sunbeam, which was preceded by at least two Conairs, and a parade of various compact (mostly) dryers over the last 32 years.  This is the BEST of the lot.

It is lightweight, which is a big plus in my book. I gave only 4 stars for 2 issues: 1) noise, and 2) cold-shot button. This is not the noisiest hair dryer I've used, but I do wish it was a bit quieter. Not enough of an issue to make me sorry I bought it. I do really wish, however, that the cold-shot button could be set so you don't have to continually hold it down. My previous hair dryer allowed the button to be set and left, which I liked a lot as I use it frequently. Luckily, the overall lightness of the dryer allows me to hold the button down fairly comfortably."	9/24/2012

If you don't apply the product several times in heavy coats you don't taste anything and it needs to be reapplied frequently (at least daily).  Also, while using the product it seemed that the taste would happen several seconds after going to bite my nails which made it rather ineffective as a control mechanism.  And when eating or drinking anything if you just so happen to touch or lick anywhere near your nail it gives your food what seems to be a more bitter and effective bad taste compared to your nails themselves.  I started to use a similar nail polish product but did not like the shine and how frequently it needed to be applied but it was much more effective and much cheaper as well.

I have been using this toothbrush for almost two years now and cannot imagine ever going back to hand brushing. There is such a marked difference between this and hand-brushing that you can literally feel. My teeth have never felt cleaner and my gums have never been healthier. While I used to have pretty bad dental hygiene habits (I used to brush only about two times a day) this toothbrush has helped me improve me regimen tremendously. The results have been nothing short of miraculous. <br /> <br />I take this toothbrush everywhere I can and the charge tends to last several days before recharging is needed. At any rate, I suppose the only shortcoming of this toothbrush lies in the problems encountered when traveling a lot: The base station is simply too bulky to conveniently pack away and take with you. While this is not an issue on shorter trips, travelling in excess of a week will make you scramble for an alternative travel toothbrush.

Unfortunately, it looks like the quality of Conair's products has gone downhill since my previous purchase. This hair dryer has a Comfort Touch coating, which I initially thought was very nice. It feels soft to the touch rather than the slick plastic of the older models. But after just a couple of weeks of use, the coating started bubbling and peeling off in the area where I hold the hair dryer. I've only had it for a month and a half, and the outer coating looks positively pathetic already. I also don't like the settings on this model--there are only two speed settings, with the lower one being barely on. The high setting is okay, but it does make me feel like I'm in a wind tunnel at times.  This hair dryer has some pros: It gets quite hot, and it's fairly lightweight. So if you don't mind your hair dryer looking like it's constantly recovering from a bad sunburn after a month of use, perhaps you'll like it."	2/21/2012

I haven't timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.<br /><br />- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I've had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn't erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don't worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.<br /><br />- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I've spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don't use a brush, don't use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It's too bad that a month before I found this I'd already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won't be needing any of those tools.<br /><br />The noise level is normal for a hairdryer. I would not say it is quiet but it is not annoyingly loud. It is also quite manageable and easy to hold.

"I absolutely don't understand the positive reviews for this hairdryer. Did I receive the wrong hairdryer or something? For starters, how can the product description say lightweight??? This thing is so bulky and heavy!! And because it takes so long to dry my hair with this thing, the heaviness of it sure doesn't help. It's apparently 1800 watts, but it feels like it's half that. I'm giving it two stars because for one, it's incredibly quiet and I've never heard a dryer this quiet and two, my hair was a bit less frizzy than with my previous ionic dryer. But these two pros aren't worth the cons. I don't see anything special about this dryer and my mother's 1875 watt Conair dryer beats this any day.    Also, has anyone done any research on this product? Google it. Have you noticed that it isn't sold in any salons, on the Farouk website, or anywhere else where you can see it's original $259.95 price?? I believe this is a cheaper, dumbed down version of a quality, more expensive Farouk product that has been released at a cheaper price so that the company has a range of affordable to higher-end priced products to widen their consumer base and profits. Nothing wrong with that, but I'm just trying to say that this definitely isn't some $260 dollar amazing hairdryer. The whole deep brilliance line seems to be a cheaper, more affordable version of Farouk products that are being advertised as if they are more higher-end, originally higher priced items. I dunno, try and find it somewhere where it was originally $259.95 or even for any other price. I sure as hell couldn't find it.     Try the hairdryer for yourself, this is just my two cents."	2/20/2008

I have thick, curly hair that I dry straight with a paddle brush.  My hair is definitely softer and smoother (I also use a leave in conditioner, glossing gel and heat protecting spray).  This dryer has cut the time it takes to dry my hair from 45 mins. to 25-30 mins. (depending on how damp my hair is when I start)  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because after the first two weeks of using the concentrator tool on a daily basis it no longer fits snug on the dryer.  It doesn't come off during use but it does rotate around and I am constantly repositioning it which is a bit annoying.  I've only had it for a few months so I can't comment on it's lifespan.

It's neither great nor horrible.<br />It does what it is designed to do - dry hair.  That's about where the positives end.  The dryer is very heavy and it takes a good seven minutes or so to dry my baby fine, shoulder length hair.  The buttons on the dryer are in an awkward place and I'm forever accidentally bumping them and switching the settings or accidentally turning it off, mid-dry.  I did not notice any difference in my hair using this dryer with its purported ion technology.  The thing that annoys me the most about this dryer is the cord.  It's nowhere near long enough for my liking.  It's so short that I barely have enough length to dry my hair without sitting down - and I'm 5'3!  Bottom line: If you need just a hairdryer for a short amount of time and don't care that it's heavy/slow/has a short cord - then this is the dryer for you."	5/7/2010

"As far as wound care goes, this tape is mediocre at best.  The tiniest amount of sweat or moisture on the skin causes it to peel right off, rendering it fairly useless for holding a dressing in place.    The one area where this tape really shines, however, is in binding orchestral sheet music parts.  The 1 Micropore tape is absolutely the best solution I've found for taping orchestral music parts together.  It sticks just enough to hold the pages together perfectly, yet not so much that it can't be repositioned without destroying your parts.  It's extremely thin, easy to tear to length, folds perfectly, and doesn't stretch at all.  It's about as sticky as masking tape, but much thinner and much stronger.    I'm constantly being complimented on how my parts are bound, and it has everything to do with this tape!    Stop using Scotch or masking tape -- and buy this immediately.  You will not be disappointed!"	12/4/2010

Great for at home or on the road."	"I recently was medically retired from the military. As part of my transition to the civilian world, I have decided to grow out my hair because, in my mind, I believe I will one day look as stylish and sexy as Leonardo Decaprio. I am finding, though, that to achieve that look there is a lot involved including blow drying your hair. Not just for style but functionality as walking around all morning with wet hair is not fun.<br /><br />This ceramic hair dryer is amazing. It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military. To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.<br /><br />This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.<br /><br />For its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful. I was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting. It comes with a cool blast button which circulates regular room air. I use this setting when blowing hair off my neck after shaving it or after cutting my children's hair.<br /><br />Probably one of the biggest selling points, since I am a man, is the stylish grey/silver/black colors that feel manly in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer my wife tried to get me to use the other morning.<br /><br />Overall, a very attractive and functional hair dryer that also has durability on its side. A great investment."	10/24/2012

"A few years ago, I used a First Class hair dryer that was provided in the Marriott Hotel and loved it. When I got home, I found this one on Amazon and ordered it. I love this hair dryer! I use it all the time - not just when traveling. It's light-weight so my arms don't get tired, and it blow dries my short haircut very quickly - about 5 mins with styling. I also like that it doesn't have that long blower on it which is harder for me to use for some reason. I saw the review about it not working right in Spain, but I was very pleased with how it worked in Greece. There is a screwlike switch you have to turn for European voltage and I wonder if the previous reviewer did not realize this? When the hair dryer is set to European voltage, there is only one speed (high), instead of the usual high and low, and I was pleasantly surprised that the hair dryer worked perfectly in Greece, just as it did at home - same strength and heat. The only maintenance was to clean the filter with an old toothbrush once in awhile as it would get covered with lint from hair products I use and then the dryer would overheat - but this is something I have to do with any hairdryer I purchase. After being used everyday for about three years, it's starting to sound as if the motor is going and so I'm back to buy another one. My daughter tried mine and liked it so much, she got one also. We both prefer this hairdryer to many other more expensive ones we've tried through the years. I highly recommend this hairdryer!"	5/30/2010

I went thru two of the Sharper images ones (first one broke) which are much more expensive and my biggest complaint always was that it scorched my head.<br /><br />Problems gone since I bought this. It is an awesome hair dryer. It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord. On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image) and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy. At a price between $18 and $22 this is the hair dryer to buy. I did, and only wish I had known about this hair dryer earlier. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Update on 9/26/2009: Almost 3 years later we're still on the same hair dryer. The cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet. It has been dropped a few times too. For the price that is excellent and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom. Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won't last long.<br /><br />Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place.

It's really big (again) - I have small hands so it's uncomfortable and unwieldy to hold and operate.  One small plus is that, although it's huge it's thankfully not very heavy.<br />3.  Watch out for the buttons!  They are placed on the handle in a way that allows you to accidentally turn the hair dryer off, change the drying speed or the temperature while you are trying to dry your hair.  Since this just happened AGAIN to me I decided to write this review!  It's uncomfortable to try and hold a huge hair dryer while having to constantly watch the position of your hand on the handle where the buttons are located so as not to change a setting while operating.<br />I'll keep this because it's easier than returning it but if I had it to do over again I would not purchase this particular hair dryer."	11/19/2012

"I've read the reviews and have to admit I really don't understand the Ion thing but whatever it is, it sure seems to be working.  My old dryer conked out so I decided to purchase this one.  With my hair looking quite damaged recently I wanted a dryer that wouldn't make it worse. I changed shampoo at the same time so I'm not sure which did it, but my hair looks so much healthier.  I have fine, straight hair and lots of it and I'm still finished drying in 5-6 minutes.  Much faster than before without the static and damage.  Love the setting controls; I use the warm, high setting and it leaves my hair really soft and healthy looking with no frizz. That alone is worth the modest investment in this product. I haven't used the attachments and don't think I will need to - a nice bonus but not something I require. I saw reports of sparks and singed hair and will be on the lookout for those things, but so far I'm extremely pleased and may order a second one for my daughter.  Kudos Revlon!"	12/11/2007

I have straight hair as is.  But coworkers and friends have been commenting a lot lately on how healthy my hair has been looking since I starting using it.<br /><br />I guess the other comments on Amazon not being an authorized dealer and therefore voiding the warranty can be a deterrant, but being able to save $100 compared to retail was significant enough for me to take a chance on that."	11/16/2008

After purchasing the T3 from an authorized dealer, I found the Good Housekeeping review that gave a favorable review of the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic. Since the Revlon is 1/10th the cost, I bought one at Target and gave both to my wife for Christmas.      I was hoping that she would find the Revlon comparable and we could save the expense of the T3.  No such luck.  She first used to T3 and found that it was much quieter than her current dryer and that it reduced the time it took to dry her hair by about 10 minutes.  When she next used the Revlon, she ended up burning her hair and refuses to ever use it again.  She's been using the T3 for about three weeks as remains very happy with it.     Being the more analytical one, I decided to do a scientific comparison between the two.  Note that I only had one sample of each dryer and I didn't use calibrated instruments, so these observations are only useful in comparing the two samples that I had.     The first and most important difference concerned the temperature of the air exiting these two dryers while set for high output and hot temperature.  The T3 held a fairly consistent temperature that most of the time fell between 190 and 210 degrees.  Extremes fell between 180 and 230 degrees, but these were for only a second or two before the temperature returned to 200+/-10 degrees.      The Revlon was much less consistent.  Its temperature continuously fluctuated between 130 and 235 degrees. Once I observed the temperature spike to almost 260 degrees.  I must have been one of these spikes the burned my wife's hair.  I took measurements over three different periods and noticed wide fluctuation during each one.  Keep in mind that I only had one sample of each dryer so these problems may be caused by a defective unit and not indicative of the entire line.      Both dryers are very quietcompared to those that my wife has used in the past.  The T3 ran at about 100 decibels at the intake and output ends and about 90 decibels on the side. From one foot away, the dryer ran from 78 to 84 decibels.   The Revlon was a little louder, running about 105db at the ends to 90db on the side.  From one foot, it in ranged from 82-89 decibels.  These measurements were taken in our bathroom which has almost no sound absorption.      The Revlon did push out more air.  On the high settings, the air exiting the Revlon had almost twice the force of that of the T3.   On the low setting, T3 had about 75% of the force of the Revlon.      Bottom line:  The Revlon had temperature problems and burned my wife's hair.  If that could be fixed, it would be a great dryer as it's 1/10 the cost on the T3.  But, right now, there's no way my wife is going to give up her T3."	1/13/2008

"We've all used the wall-mounted blow dryers in hotels, and then gone home to the unit sitting on the counter-top in our bathroom.  I finally broke down and purchased this wall-mounted unit and put it in my wife's bathroom.  It only took a couple of minutes to install the mounting plate with the supplied hardware.  What a difference.  No more cords dangling in the sink and knocking items on the floor.  I chose this model because it has a removable filter to allow easier cleaning.  My feelings about blow dryers is that they're pretty much all the same within price ranges.  I don't expect a $35 item to last 10 years. . . I will happily replace it when it wears out.  This one works fine and I don't have any complaints.  I'd buy it again tomorrow if faced with the same need and happily recommend it to anyone who's considering a purchase."	2/26/2010

I have heard rave reviews about the T3, which my stylist uses. However, the concerns regarding whether the manufacturer will honor the warranty if you buy from Amazon turned me off. I noticed that there were mixed postings however on whether the manufacturer will or will not honor the warranty. So, after hunting around on Amazon, I realized that there are two manufacturers selling the T3 on Amazon, with a significant price difference: Beauty Collection and Discount Jungle. Beauty Collection specifically states in its warranty description that it will honor the 48 month manufacturer. I plan to buy the dryer, but read the product description before you buy and decide whether the difference in price is worth buying with the warranty."	7/25/2008

I blow my curly hair straight and then flat iron it smooth.  My old cheapo dryers would create a mushroom-shaped pouf on my head, which, in turn, would take forever to flat iron out.  This dryer makes my hair noticeably smoother (and much less freaky!) and cuts my time with the flat iron in half!  I did give it four stars instead of five because it is slightly on the heavy side, but not so heavy that I would return it.  I would purchase it again.  Maybe it will help me work on the muscle tone in my arms :)"	3/25/2009

It's been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all. There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain...I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine. I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you'll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it's as good as it gets.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day. It's fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times, and still works like a charm. The other day (now about 6 months ago) however, the button to retract the cord flew off (with spring) while the cord was furiously being pulled out. I tried to reattach but it lost its retracting mechanism. Fine, now it's a regular drier. Although I do have to admit it's definitely very powerful for its size, quite amazing actually. Still works like a charm."	8/14/2009

I decided to take a chance on the Farouk Deep Brilliance, based on the great reviews, great price, and the Farouk name.  Some may be put off by the bright orange color, but mine gets stowed in a cabinet, so it's not a decorative accessory. The quality is outstanding and hopefully will be around more that a year or two.  Even more impressive is the way it styles may hair.  I have short hair and the high setting dries my hair in no time.  I love the lower setting for styling with my round brush.

If you like Creed's version of Original Vetiver, but find it a bit too clean and light for a vetiver, you REALLY must try Guerlain's formulation. This set is not the newest recipe, but the previous one from the 90s. Apparently the newer version is a bit brighter, but not nearly as rich.<br /><br />This starts clean with a hint of lemon and grass clippings, but quickly dries down to an earthy and slightly mineralic cedar. Final dry down is to a rich and exceptionally warm woody oak-moss with a powdery overlay. Soapy-clean permeates throughout the entire range of the scent.  This is mature, masculine and a barbershop-clean classic. Makes Creed's version seem flat and incredibly overpriced.<br /><br />The EDT miniature is splash only (no spray). The aftershave lotion smells even warmer than the EDT, due to high oil content and no alcohol.

With the Conair the cord is too short, I do not like the angle of the handle, it`s so heavy I repeatedly bumped myself on the head with it, it`s noisy, though I wonder why because there is little air flow, and, worst of all, it does not work any better than my old non-ionic hair dryer. That one was at least quick. I have naturally straight hair, fine but lots of it, and it took me more than 10 min to blow my short style dry. I don`t even want to imagine that with long hair! In the end my hair looked so shaggy and messy that I honestly told my hair dresser to step up her game or else.

I timed it and dried my fine, wavy chin length hair straight in 4 minutes (I also used the Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush). The retractable cord prevents cord tangles and extra cord weight. This blowdryer is easy to use and a great value for the price!<br /><br />Update: 11/25/12<br />Almost a year later, the blowdryer still works very well. Nothing broke and I enjoyed it all year. Today I took off one star, however, because the dryer doesn't come with enough options: no styling nozzle or difuser. The settings are also very basic. So I did buy a new blowdryer (from a different brand) for not much more money than ths one, in order to have more options such as two styling nozzles and options for 3 temperatures at different  blowing speeds. Still, I believe I got my money's worth with this very decent Andis."	1/13/2012

There are 2 air speeds and 2 heat settings plus a no heat button vs. 3 air/heat settings. The air speed, and not much of it, is the same on high and medium; the heat changes. On low, the heat is the same as medium but the air flow decreases.    I have medium-long hair and was looking for a dryer with three distinct settings. This doesn't have them. My old and working Conair has only two settings and is more effective than this. At 1875 watts, the air flow on this is sad. Perhaps that's intentional and I just fail to understand why high isn't very high. The cool air button on the back is marginally inconvenient. Regardless, here's one to avoid and I'm going to try to return the one I got."	1/15/2011

"After having read the majority of the reviews here, I'm happy to report that this dryer is fast and very lightweight.  My hairdresser who uses this dryer daily had recommended it to me awhile back. Unfortunately, I bought back then what I thought was a better more economical option: an Andis Ionic hairdryer with a retractable cord and folding handle. While very light weight and space-saving, I soon learned after several months of frequent use that either the cord was going to fray from from the retracting into the handle or worse, the handle could break from folding.  Well, it did.  After the handle broke, I decided to purchase this hair dryer and I regret not having done so sooner.  What a great hairdryer - very lightweight, dries hair quickly to a smooth satiny shine.  I have straight, medium length, medium thickness hair that usually would take at least 45 minutes to dry.  Well, the T3 cut the drying time to 14 minutes and that's taking my time. The T3 dryer is also very quiet and despite having only 2 speeds and a cold shot button, does the job quite nicely and I don't miss having all of the other speeds.  This was well worth the price and I wouldn't ordinarily spend this much on a hair dryer.  But the results are well worth it.  Highly recommend!"	4/5/2007

"After several years of daily used, my trusty Conair 1875 finally quit on me.  Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!  So, I gave this baby five stars and hope to have it around for four or five years like all the other Conairs before it."	5/13/2012

After trying unsuccessfully to get her to unplug it and put it away, I realized her life would be a whole lot easier if I just got her a wall mount hair dryer and deliberately mount it next to where she stands in front of the sink rather than mount it right next to the sink itself.  That solves a lot of problems: she doesn't have to use up drawer space for the dryer, I don't have to worry about her putting it away hot, it is always plugged in and ready, the coil cord never drags over the sink (so nothing getting knocked off the sink), and of course the risk of the dryer falling into the sink is practically eliminated.<br /><br />This hair dryer is conveniently small so it's easy to handle, even for a young teen with long hair.  It dries hair quickly because it is powerful despite its size.<br /><br />Wall mounting was trivially simple -- it took less than five minutes with my hand dandy drill/driver, bits, level, and a hand screwdriver (it is much better to use a manual screwdriver instead of a drill/driver to screw into wall anchors).  It comes with a wall template with a leveling line which makes the job go especially quickly."	1/14/2013

"My conair hair dryer stopped turning off the other day so I started searching online for a new one (I do this about every 1.5yrs b/c they eventually die on me).  Happened to come across this hair dryer and was intrigued though not sure what to believe.  After all, it's *just* a hair dryer and ridiculously expensive!  It got good and bad reviews so I figured I'd try it out.  I decided to buy one at Nordstrom because if I didn't like it, I could return it and if I did like it, I'd have the full warranty.     To my surprise it did an AMAZING job and I'm not very skilled at styling and blow drying my hair at the same time.    I washed my hair with the same shampoo and conditioner I've been using for a few months and I towel dried it a little but my hair still felt very wet.  I did not put any product in my hair afterward like I normally do.  I used the hair dryer while sitting on the floor in my bedroom and used my brush as usual and dried/brushed it without a mirror.  It definitely dried my hair faster than other hair dryers, but I'm not sure how much time it shaved off overall.  When I was all done, my hair felt nice, but nothing stuck out UNTIL I looked in the mirror!  It was nice and smooth (no flyaways) which I can usually only get this look when I use shine/smoothing serum on my hair.  And when I do that, I'm looking in the mirror and constantly brushing/styling as I'm drying it.  This was actually pretty effortless and I'm thrilled that I didn't have to put anything in my hair to achieve a nice, smooth, professional look.  Very impressed after first try and I'd recommend this hair dryer to anyone."	7/29/2008

I was fed up having cheap blow dryers that never lasted. I loved the blow dryer, it lasted me till a month ago. Guess the $110 I paid for it back then was worth the 6 years I got out of it. I was looking at buying the same one or at least a Chi blow dryer again, I just didn't want to spend the same amount of money, I was hoping to stay under $60. I did a bunch of research and saw that this blow dryer, T3 Featherweight, was on the list of best blow dryers the last few years and saw the price was close to what I wanted to pay and $30 cheaper than the Chi I had before. I also saw that it said it was a fast drying blow dryer like my old Chi, which I prefer since I have a ton of hair. After using it for over a week. I think it works pretty good.. not much difference from my Chi I had. It's lighter than my chi and it's made of some kind of plastic like material. It also looks solid white and black in the picture, but it's actually got some kind of silver pattern going on over the white which I'm not thrilled with, but it's not the reason I bought the blow dryer so I'll get over it. Seems to take about the same amount of time to blow dry my hair as the chi, maybe a little faster. I usually take about 8-15 minutes to blow dry my hair depending on how detailed i get with it, like I said I have a ton of hair. (thick Mid-back length hair)<br /><br />Why I give this a 4 instead of a 5, I prefer my Chi a little more, maybe it's the solid feel of it. I think it's maybe the material, it feels too light.<br /><br />The biggest test is going to be to see how long it last. If it makes it 5 years + then I will be happy with it."	5/1/2012

They averaged about 6 months each or $42 (3x13.99) for 18 months of use.	"This is a basic somewhat compact blow dryer that worked well in the beginning. As described it has two blower speeds and two heat settings and that's it. The cord is a decent length without being too long or too short. If anything the high speed blower setting might be too fast, but it's not a big problem. However, I have had three of these , so read the updates.  Update#1: After  3 months the first one is still blowing and going. Came back and ordered another. Nothing but good things to say about this little hair dryer.  Update# 2: June 17, 2013: The first of two dryers I bought like this one stopped working today. It lasted about 10 months before the off/on switch smoked and went limp. It flops back and forth completely useless. Not as much of a bargain as I thought at first. But, I am ordering another and writing this bad switch off as bad luck. My 3rd one is on the way.  Update #3: In less than 4 months the second hair dryer quit. That is 2 of the three we own. I am not buying a fourth one.  Update #4: The third dryer has quit. Not one of the three lasted more than 10 months. It is not worth the hassle to return these cheap hair dryers. The cost of shipping both ways is more than buying a new one. Three hairdryers in just over a year all bought here on Amazon. The one I used the longest lasted 10 months. Andis is not a quality hair dryer in fact to me it is the definition of &#34;too cheap to be true&#34; junk."	8/9/2012

Next to laundry, blow drying my hair is my least favorite thing to do.  I was looking for something that would blow dry my hair fast.  I have very fine hair, longer than shoulder length. The first day I used this blow dryer I had it on medium heat and it took 10 minutes. That is how long my old blow dryer took, but my hair looked much healthier than with other blow dryers. The next day I used it, I set it to hot and it took only 5 minutes!  It still looked great, just as healthy!  My hair is always breaking and when I blow dry, normally the damage is very apparent.  With this blow dryer my hair looks smooth and shiny!  I love this blow dryer.  I highly recommended it!!"	5/24/2011

The wall mount is very convenient.  Because we installed it low on a cabinet and the cord is a bit short, we hung it upside-down (i.e. cord on top), which requires the fifth (optional) screw through the hole in the magnet (otherwise it would slip right off the wall mount).

It is by far the best hair clipper I have ever owned.   First things first...this baby holds a charge! It has over an hour of run time on a full charge. And if the charge does run out, it works with its AC charger plugged in. So you're never stuck with half a haircut and a dead set of clippers.   The cutter is powerful. The blades move fast so they don't pull your hair, they cut it.  Its adjustable cut settings and its pivoting spacer comb combine to produce a great, easy haircut. I also use it to trim my beard. The primary spacer comb easily pops off for easy cleaning, or to attach one of the specialty combs and cutters that also come with it.  I enthusiastically recommend this product."	8/5/2010

The first one was terrible.  The one I got rid of had a short barrel and sucked my hair into the intake in the back and ended up burning up the 3rd time I used it.  I've had this one a little over a month and it is so much better.  Easy to mount.  Easy to use.  I love that it turns off when you set it back in the cradle.  Cord gives enough to stretch down low when I blow dry my daughters hair.  Only negative is that there is no heat control.  High air setting has high heat.  Medium air has medium heat.  Low air has luke warm heat.  But since I prefer the high air/high heat it works ok for me.  I recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE12/2012:  Around the beginning of 2012 the unit's high setting stopped working.  Or rather it works intermittently.  Sometimes it will come on but most times it does not.  This makes it hard to dry thick or long hair.  The heat & air volume on the other settings doesn't cut it if you want to dry your hair quickly or if you have a lot of hair.  Still pretty good product in terms of size/design/price and maybe I'm expecting too long a life from a hair dryer, but I do know that most of the others dryers I've owned lasted 6-8 years.  Was hoping at least that much out of this one."	12/4/2009

I don't even KNOW a man who uses a hairdryer, so I don't know why this is for Men. That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don't ask me to explain what that Ionic setting does---the manufacturer doesn't even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn't fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people's food.  I only wash it once a week because it's so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don't perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I've had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I've had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.<br /><br />I like the design of this hairdryer---it's fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There's nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don't know. I DON'T CARE!<br /><br />I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, That was the best experience I've ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.<br /><br />Please don't comment that this can't possibly work and it's all unscientific and that I'm making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews. For me, this hairdryer makes a positive difference (pun intended) on my hair. Now I'm going to buy one for my daughter-in-law!"	4/5/2012

Typically, one doesn't put as much effort into vacation hairstyling, but despite that, my hair always turned out better while away than when at home.  Though it's quiet to the point that I hadn't expected much power from it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it very efficient.

It impressed me there immediately. I love how this little guy packs a big punch in a little package. I wanted something that isn't monstrous and a labor to hold up to use. Also it doesn't take up much wall real estate (a big plus). The night light is a neat feature and won't create a distracting moon glow that will bleed into the bedroom. It also doesn't demand any quirky requirement to place it back in its mount. It easily snaps right back in without any trouble unlike you find with some cordless tool mounts.	7/14/2011

"I just started using an ionic hairdryer recently after my cousin requested one as a Christmas gift. I used hers once and I was hooked. My hair is long (mid-back long),wavy and usually frizzy if I don't use straightening products or a blow dryer straightening hair attachment. It used to take me atleast half an hour to completely dry my hair straight on a regular dryer high setting. With the ionic dryer my hair (WITHOUT any balms, gels or attachments) is super shiny, has lots of volume and dries in half that time and has gotten more straighter! There is an even better newer model Conair IonShine Dryer 1875 that has a more ergonomic handle with better settings and buttons. I would recommend this to all my friends and family."	1/7/2003

"Okay, how could I have lived 63years and never thought of installing a hair dryer on the wall?  It's a no brainer!  Dragging out the hairdryer every day and trying to put it away neatly is a hassle and there is no reason to put up with it any longer!  I bought 2 Oster 76932-710 and put one up in my bathroom and the other in the spare bath.  Now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice hotel upgrade.  Everybody comments on what a good idea.    The 710 watt Oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair.  The dryer snaps easily in and out of the holder.  It took me about 30 minutes to install both dryers...and that included the time it took me to find my drill and try and read 3/16 on the drill bit!  Buy this...it will only make you happy!"	1/30/2010

Although I had never heard of this brand before, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It has very easy to use speed and heat settings, the low setting is just right for my fine hair, but still gets hot at that speed (unlike the Conair I was using). It's not heavy, the 'ion' technology seems to be working.. My hair dries much faster, with less frizz, higher shine and so far with less damage to my hair. Results from this drier don't even compare to my previous Conair 255R. Also WAY better than a Bed Head drier I bought a few years back. Buy this one."	3/7/2012

"This product has delivered higher results than I expected. This was my third purchase; I take the recommended six tablets per day; I'm in my fourth month of using this supplement and I plan to continue with it, indefinitely.

My fine hair seems no thicker - but - where there was a noticeable receding hairline, all the hair has regrown and that sure is wonderful. Complexion and fingernails show nice improvements, but the most remarkable for me is that I no longer need to wear supports for my ankles when I'm active. I suffered a degree of permanent damage to the tendons in both ankles many years ago, to the point that I had to be careful just getting out of bed in the morning.

"I purchased this dryer almost 2 years ago. Just yesterday the switch broke-- it was a very sad day. After trying out at least 5 other dryers, I found this to be BY FAR the best for the money. It is relatively quiet for the airflow it produces- no hi-pitched whine like some other models. And it is VERY POWERFUL! It is heavier than others, but I don't mind getting a little extra muscle tone. It doesn't have a shiny plastic finish and can withstand being dropped many times on a tile bathroom floor-- trust me.<br /><br />I have long, fine hair that will get unruly and curly against my wishes unless dried a certain way. The high blower setting with medium heat works great for me, plus I use the cold shot and a big roller brush to create volume. It is very versatile, with two blower settings and three heat settings.<br /><br />Wish the one I had would have lasted, but I'm not taking any chances with another dryer. This works as well as any $100 dryer as far as I'm concerned. Only gripes are 1) the switch breaking and 2) the cord is long (great) but it tends to get all twisted up on itself even though it was designed not to. For these reasons it fell just short of 5 stars<br /><br />**Update - November 2013**  Well, I bought it again. This one lasted for five and a half years! It bit the dust, and actually produced flames on it's way out! They may have originated from the switch mechanism. It was a quite spectacular, and quite frightening, way for it to go. Because of safety concerns, I will not be purchasing this hair dryer again."	1/13/2008

It feels like you just had your teeth cleaned every time you brush!  Up until amazon started carrying the product you had no option but to buy it at the dentist office with their marked up price.  Now, with the price cut in half, I could afford 2 of these for everyone in the house.<br /><br />The sterilization chamber holds 2 brusheads of either size and angles them towards a sanitation UV lamp (254 nm) - the cycle runs 15 minutes which is sufficient to kill anything on the bristles after use.  I've had my brushes over a year now and still am using the origianl lamp.  You get two indications that it is working, a flashing led above which goes steady once the process is finished and the chamber has not been opened (then it goes out) - plus the philips logo lights up from the UV inside but blocks the harmful rays from escaping by flourescing in the UV glow of the lamp.<br /><br />This is a good system for children, as it has reminder buzzes on when to move on to the next set of teeth, and has 5 different cycles from gentile to vigorous.  My dentist recommended it to me, and I recommend it to anyone who doesnt't want to see their dentist as often!<br /><br />Positives:  It charges using an induction charger - meaning there are no exposed wires.  A coil hides behind the charging station and a second coil is inside the toothbrush.  When they are in close proximity (2) they couple energy from the AC line to the brush under charge.  This is a safe method of charging and does not require cords to plug into the brush.<br /><br />Negatives:  The system has one li-ion battery.  Once it expires, philips provides a mechanism to use a screwdriver to remove the battery before throwing away the toothbrush, thus guaranteeing you will buy another one.  It would have been as easy to put a cap on the bottom allowing you to replace the expired battery at that time and then continue to use the brush electronics, which are very robust.<br /><br />Of all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.

Found this one online and so far, it's great. I love that it has options. 4 heat settings and 3 speeds with a cold shot feature and independent controls for many drying combinations. It was the only one I found like it. While the speed isn't as fast and the heat isn't quite as hot as the old one, it still does the job well and my hair will probably be happier for it! After returning one that felt awkward and top heavy, I like that this one feels light and balanced. I don't have need for the 2 attachments but they seem good quality. Hoping it lasts as long as it's predecessor!"	12/5/2012

Most likely just one broke off, and its rattling around inside the housing immediately caused others to start breaking. Now the dryer is worthless.

It keeps retracting even when i want to use the dryer. I have to stand very close to the plug point and I cannot dry or style my hair comfortably. Although the dryer is in working condition(as of now), the chord makes it impossible to work with. So please do not get carried away with this fancy pink color and retractable chord facility. I too read the reviews and was very excited to use this product but it was a bad experience for me. I would suggest a regular simple(long and dangling) chord dryer rather than a complex retractable. Also, i find this dryer a little bit more heavier than other dryers, making my hairstyling time very painful and also long."	2/2/2012

You can't heat these clips in the Remington unit, but they can withstand the very hot velour rollers, as well as blow-dryer heat.

Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.  I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan."	4/1/2007

"I have finely textured, shoulder-length hair, but a lot of it, so it seems to take forever to dry it.  My old dryer was pretty heavy, so much so my shoulder would begin to hurt before I could finish.  This past August, I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott while moving my son into his college dorm.  Having to pack lightly for myself, I counted on using whatever dryer the hotel provided.  When I saw how small the Andis Pro Style 1600 dryer in the hotel room was, I was skeptical of its power.  I was pleasantly surprised!  In addition to being lightweight, it was very effective.  I remarked to my husband at how quickly I was able to dry my hair (even with the Florida humidity) and that I wanted one of the dryers.  Since I could get it on Amazon for $13.99, I thought what the heck, I won't be gambling too much if it doesn't work.  I have been using it at least 3 times a week for the last 9 weeks or so without any problems. My dogs did not like it when we used the old dryer on them after a bath, but it is almost as if they like this one!

In all honesty, I never use the hanger. I leave my cord dangle. It actually helps to detract from the power cord that runs to the outlet. If I hang the cord, I actually feel like that just spreads out the cord mess. That may be something to consider if you are buying this model for the cord hanger.    The nighlight is not as bright as some of these reviews would have you believe. If you go from having a completely dark bathroom to having this light, you will notice the room is much brighter at night, but the light is no brighter than any other night light.    You will need the right size allen wrench to switch the dryer from 1200W to 1600W as this does not come with the dryer.     I had no problems with the screw length for mounting as others have stated, so they may have fixed that problem.    This dryer is much quiter than my previous dryer which was an 1875W regular handheld model. It's not silent, but it is quieter than any dryer I've owned.    Even though this and other wall mounted dryers have lower wattage, I don't notice a significate increase in drying time (maybe a minute or two). I actually prefer the lower wattage now because I'm not blasting my hair (or scalp!) with heat which tended to cause split ends and fry my hair after continued use (I don't curl or use a flat iron, so the difference is purely a result of the hair dryers). Also, once I finish blow drying, my hair looks like it will for the rest of the day (an moderate amount of volume), whereas with the 1875W dryer, my hair would be a pouf ball first thing in the morning and gradually flatten to my head by the end of the day.     Other notes: The dryer itself is a medium size. I like that it's not one of the tiny ones because I feel like it's not flimsy and weak (even if smaller ones really aren't). It's also not as big and heavy as full sized dryers, so I find that I move it around much more and get more even drying."	3/9/2010

When I first started using T3's pro ionic/ceramic hair dryer last year,I noticed and felt an immediate difference on my hair. After using it for about two months, I'm very happy with the results. My hair became more manageable and is less frizzy. It is soft and smooth. I thought all the Touramaline ionic/ceramic hair dryers would produce similar results. So I was searching for a less expensive alternative one so that I can have two ionic dryers on hand. I read the positive reviews on this Andis hair dryer, then I decided to purchase it. I'm thankful the delivery was super fast! After using it a few times, I have to say the result is just mediocre. Compare to T3, this Andis model loses its shine! My hair feels dry after using it. It doesn't seem to be able to smooth out my hair or create shine and eliminate frizz as well as the T3 does. It works just like a regular hair dryer for me, except because of the ionic in it, it does dry hair faster than non-ionic hair dryers. Overall, here are the pros & cons in my opinion on this Andis 75370 Tourmaline ionic/ceramic hair dryer.<br /><br />PROS: It has a beautiful black and gold finish on the exterior; a good size for home use; powerful air flow; dries hair fast; 3 heat settings/2 air speeds; has the cool shot button;<br /><br />CONS: feels heavy on hand & noisy; heat settings/air speeds settings are in odd position, the switches seem to get in the way while holding and using the dryer; the blue ion indicator light is extremely bright, it's very annoying; the overall result in terms of adding silkiness and shine isn't impressive; not sure if the heating material is made with solid ceramic?<br /><br />The Bottom line: This hair dryer is not bad, it does the drying job alright. I just don't think it's great for those with thick/wavy & coarse hair type hoping to get smoother and luster result after blow dry. If your hair type is normal & fine, frizz is not the major concern for you, you may be okay and satisfied with this one.w dry.

It is dependable and delivers the temperatures I expect, but the main reason I chose this model is that the classic squirrel-cage blower produces great air flow. I was never satisfied with the wimpy blowers on most of the other styles.     I bought two of these from Amazon a few years ago. Two, because I thought such an inexpensive dryer might not last long very long and buying the pair was a better bargain because the order qualified for free shipping. The second one is still in the box awaiting its turn; the first one hasn't failed yet.    I see several comments here about travel. While this dryer is more compact than many of the bulky styling dryers, it is neither dual voltage (switchable) nor universal voltage (auto-converting), so pack a converter if you carry it overseas.  I use a smaller, folding, dual-voltage model for travel (then find that all the hotels have built-ins anyway)."	3/26/2011

It's a 'Hair' Dryer!	"I wasn't in the market for a new hair dryer but, thanks to my husband, who deep sixed my old one using it to thaw frozen water pipes at our cabin, I needed a new one. He thought the dryer just needed to 'rest' for a bit and then it would be 'fine' . . . so he didn't bother to tell me it had blown its last burst of air under our kitchen sink! I now needed to find a replacement hair dryer, something impossible to do on a Holiday when all the stores are closed and you need to be somewhere in half an hour!<br />FYI: If you, too, have a husband who has to thaw water pipes and has used your hair dryer, for that purpose, I suggest you point him in the direction of the [[ASIN:B00004TI25 Milwaukee 6 Dual Temperature Heat Gun]]. If he takes the hint you can avoid having to go to a 'Very Important Family Event' scaring small children (and some adults, I might add!) looking like a demented survivor from a shipwreck! I still cannot fathom why steam coming out of my ears and fire from the burning coals in my eyes didn't dry my hair! Where was a hot flash when I needed one? I'm over it - or I will be as soon as all the pictures and negatives have been destroyed! However, I digress, so back to my review.<br />I am glad I selected this hair dryer. It has proved to be an excellent choice. Dries my hair much faster and seems to leave it silkier which is saying a lot since I have gray hair that has a mind of its own.

I have to completely and forcefully dry it in order to tame it down.  I've bought dozens of blow dryers in my lifetime to battle my hair, most from the drugstore.  Despite having consistently mediocre-to-poor experiences with these cheapies, I stupidly found myself continuing to buy them.  I have no fewer than 4 unused Conairs relegated to the hall closet because they don't perform acceptably.  And that's in addition to the countless ones that I've thrown away when they broke.      So I finally decided to change tactics and buy a higher end model.  My hair stylist recommended the Elchim brand, as that's what they use in the salon I go to (Vidal Sassoon salon).  It's definitely a step up from the Conair, but there are some things I don't love about it.    Things I Like:  -Good, strong air flow  -Feels Solid - plastic feels strong and not flimsy.  I've only had it for a few weeks, so it remains to be seen how durable it is compared to the drugstore cheapies, but it feels like it won't break as quickly.  -Long cord so you can move around as needed  -3 settings each for air flow and heat    Things I Don't Like:  -Hottest setting is extremely hot.  I burned my finger by touching MY HAIR after drying a lock on the hottest setting!  Unfortunately, the medium setting isn't quite hot enough.  So I've been using the hottest setting and moving it around fast so it doesn't heat up one area long enough to fry my hair or my fingers.  It's tiring and I'm hoping it doesn't damage my hair long term.  -No cool shot.    Overall, seems like a step up from the cheap drugstore dryers because the air flow is much better and it feels more durable (we'll see if that proves true over time), but for some people it might not be worth paying twice as much."	8/24/2009

I have generally been very pleased with Conair hair dryers, and the Ion feature seems to really tame the frizz.  However, the blower on this model is very slow, so it takes a long time.  Sometimes I have to pull out my old dryer to get the wet out, then use this one to finish -- otherwise it would take me 20 minutes to dry my hair.  Also, the high/low setting is for the blower only, which is useless since high is so slow anyway.  The heat is not controlable, except for the COLD button you have to hold down to get just air.  As other reviewers have noted, the buttons are terrible.  I almost can't hold it by the handle without turning it off.  Occasionally I have gotten through with drying and realized the Ion feature got turned off -- how annoying, especially after having spent 20 minutes drying my hair."	11/3/2004

I didn't notice anything better or worse then most hairdryers I have owned except that it does automatically shut off if you use it too long. I guess it overheats? It will pop the circuit and I let it cool a bit and then hit the reset and it works fine again. If you have thick hair that takes a while to dry this would not be the hairdryer for you.<br /><br />UPDATE: So a few months later and this hairdryer has turned out to be not so great after all.

He bought me both the Featherweight hair dryer and the wet and dry narrow flat iron from t3. I love both of them! The hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes (when it is wet from the shower)- I have asian hair so I can say that drying my hair isn't always a positive experience. However, if you dry your hair with the hot option first (doing the layers), then on the low option for the roots of your hair, and finishing with a blast of cool air all over, you will have shiny hair that is not poofy and is manageable.  <br />After using my t3 hair dryer, I don't know how I could not have it. Now, I want to get the overnight dryer. However, here is a warning. DO NOT EXPECT MIRACLES! If you have super frizzy hair or completely unmanageable hair, a hair dryer will not fix that. Perhaps you should invest in some better shampoo (I recommend Bumble and Bumble or Paul Mitchell) and perhaps a hair treatment at the salon. This dryer is great for getting the job done quickly and to make your hair look better (without that frizzy, burned look that other hair dryers give you)."	3/13/2007

This was a great choice.  The dryer is much much lighter than what I'm used to and has a nice smooth feel (as in, it doesn't feel light plastic under my hands, but more of a rubbery-feel - very pleasant!).  It is also just as powerful as the 213x.  It has 2 speeds (gale-force wind and normal), and 3 heat settings.  I use the gale-force winds on medium heat and my hair 4-5 below my shoulder, thin-medium thickness, is dry in under 3 minutes.  My younger sister tried it out and put it on gale-force high heat and she said it didn't stay on for more than a few seconds.  My thoughts are it could have been my outlet (I live in a very old apartment building - circa 1900s) unable to handle the current flow OR it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over-heating.  Either way its not a problem for me since high heat hurts my head and ears and makes me feel as if I'm destroying my hair!  All-in-all its a great value for the price."	3/11/2010

Imagine my surprise when I did a Google search and found that this dryer is for ethnic hair and has a powerful  1300 watts. POWERFUL 1300 WATTS? Are you kidding? No wonder it sucks. Maybe it's good for ethnic hair, but for a caucasian girl with long fine hair it just adds about 10 minutes to my drying time. Don't waste your money on this unless you are looking for a dryer that puts out as much air as a floor fan. The people who wrote rave reviews on this must have been brainwashed by the deal they got.

I thought about getting an ionic dryer but my hair dresser said that it really wouldn't make a difference. I'm very happy with this dryer and I'm going to buy one for my mom.	4/15/2008

I personally think it does a better job on the genital area than on the bikini area.  It really makes a difference at what angles your hair grows, and if your hair is on the smoother side and grows very parallel to your skin (like it does on the areas that would show right around my bikini line), it's tough to get it all with this shaver.  It does a good job on the more coarse hair in more intimate areas, as those stand at more of a perpendicular angle (especially when they're short and stubbly after having been shaved a few days before).    You will have to pull gently at your skin and/or hold it in a kind of pinched way sometimes to make sure you get all of the hairs at an angle the shaver will reach, but none of that is painful and it does work.  You'll also have to go over each area more than once, so plan on devoting a few minutes to the process (more than that for your first time or two), because you won't be able to get it all super quickly with the multiple runs over areas and the need to stretch and pull your skin.  I haven't really had any experiences of it pinching or nicking my skin.  Do use some sort of baby powder, particularly in damper areas to make the skin dry and easy to run the shaver over.    I use a compressed air can, along with the little cleaning brush that comes with it, to clean it after each use.  I don't think the brush does a thorough job on its own.    Overall I'm quite happy with this product and would recommend it as a worthwhile purchase.  I have to use it pretty much every day to stay truly smooth, and there are a couple tiny areas that I tend to run a razor over (going in the same direction as the hair so it won't create razor burn) after using the shaver just because the hair in those places isn't at enough of an angle for the shaver to really reach.  You would definitely need to use a trimmer to get the hair to a short stubble before using this shaver; I opted for actually shaving everything with a razor first, and then using the shaver to shave the stubble once it started growing back a day or two later, and have continued doing that stubble maintenance ever since.    The battery life is also pretty good.  I've had the razor for about six months now and have changed the batteries only once so far, probably a couple of months in, while using it every few days."	8/5/2010

It's performance is decent (dries hair quickly with less frizz), but it's design and construction leave something to be desired.    Issues:  1) It's really heavy so be prepared for your arm to get a work-out when using it.  2) The placement of the cord retractor button is really bad. If you set the dryer down on it's side sometimes the retractor button will get bumped causing your dryer to slide across the counter.  3) About 1 month ago the on/off button popped off. I was able to stick it back on, but it will occasionally still fall off during use.  4) The cord retractor is somewhat dangerous and also will get stuck occasionally during cord retraction.  5) The placement of the cool shot requires you to hold the dryer awkwardly to keep from accidentally pressing it.    Maybe it's just a matter of preference in design, but this dryer has been  very awkward and difficult for me to use. I just don't think that the performance is good enough to put up with all of the negatives. I will probably shell out a little more money the next time I purchase a hair dryer and get something better."	10/16/2007

After a lot of research, I nailed to buy this item. I was excited to see that it would get delivered in 2 days. I was eagerly waiting for it. An unknown carrier called Ensenda was chosen to deliver this to me. They took their own sweet 3 days after much of follow ups from me to deliver the item. With much expectation, I opened the item just to find out it would not work. I was doubting my own mental caliber to operate such a simple instrument, tried out different options, nothing would work. I took the drier to 4 different power points in the house, no luck. To make sure that I m not doing a mistake, I asked my roomie to check if it would work, no luck. The first thing I did next day morning was to ship this back to Amazon and got a Conair Ion Shine Ceramic 1875. Also, buyers please dont get carried away by its glossy looks, it looks stylish in the image, but looks cheap in reality. The control buttons are also bad.

"I bought this hair dryer based on all the glowing reviews I read about it.  So of course when it arrived, I was excited to see just how fabulous a job it was going to do drying my hair.    Okay for starters, this thing has 2 settings:  slow and hot, fast and heat-of-a-thousand-suns hot.  The setting that this dryer has for low on the heat side would be about as hot I would normally dry my hair...but since there's no speed setting to choose from, I'd be in the bathroom for about an hour trying to get my hair dry.    The thing is a little clumsy to hold and the nozzle is just slightly bigger than a silver dollar so there's not even a LOT of air coming out of it.    I turned it on, used it for about 2 minutes, repacked it into the box and came out here to immediately begin the return process.    Save your money.  This thing isn't the savior of hair care products like other reviews would lead you to believe.  It's overpriced for what you get and not impressive at all."	3/19/2008

After I bought the Andis, I was washing my hair every 3rd day, and it crapped out on me after a few months. I would not recommend buying this blow dryer. :-("	10/19/2010

"i have heard about ENjoy products a few times, and it was recommended by my hairstylist. I still went out on a limb by ordering this pomade, but I LOVE IT!!! I have long straight hair, but after i blowdry/straighten it, it's still a little frizzy and i have flyaways. This pomade helps a ton, you only need about the size of a nickel, and you can use it from root to tip without it looking oily (of course if you use too much, that might not be the case).  Also, is smells SOOOO great! The price is good, i can see it lasting for a long time since a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with the same need as i had.  ;)"	3/11/2010

What I like most about this hair dryer is that it is quiet....really quiet...a big plus!  I think my only dislike is that the on/off is above the heat setting.  Where you naturally hold it your thumb is closest to the heat setting, so every time I go to shut it off I hit the temp instead.

This one has a powerful heating element (1875 watts), and a good fan (for its size). The purpose of a hair dryer is not to heat up the hair to boil away the water, but to speed up the evaporation process of drying by exposing the hair to a stream of hot air. The faster the stream and the warmer the air, the more evaporation occurs.  Where this dryer differs is in the body that has a longer and narrower nozzle that is about one inch wide. This forces a much stronger blast of air (at least on high speed) that is not a wide as those dryers with a wide nozzle.<br /><br />If your hair is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly, you would want a different dryer with a wider nozzle to diffuse the heat so that the hair dries more slowly at a cooler temperature. That may make the hair less likely to frizz and it may give the hair more volume.<br /><br />This dryer makes the nozzle narrow and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot in order to make the hair it blows on dry rapidly. You can adjust the fan speed and the temperature, but not the concentration of the air flow.<br /><br />So, if you have regular hair or (like me) are a guy that just wants to dry their hair rapidly, this is the dryer for you. Put it on high speed and high heat and it is extremely fast."	10/23/2012

"I also ordered the Silver Bird 2000W Turbo Hair Dryer at the end of January 2012 but was sent a Black Bird 2000W Hair Dryer instead. It was obvious someone stuck the Black Bird hair dryer in a plastic bag that was sealed with regular Scotch tape and had a small label with a bar code and a description for the Silver Bird dryer.  As soon as I received it, I contacted Amazon's Customer Service via an online chat and told them they sent me the wrong item. I was sent a link for a UPS return label, which I printed out. I asked the rep if they could arrange for UPS to pick the package up since I live in a very rural area, and they were responsible for the fulfillment and shipping of the product. I was told that I would have to find a UPS drop-off point myself. (It was very frustrating dealing with the online chat rep.)  I tracked the return of the package to Amazon and waited for my refund. Six business days AFTER they received the hair dryer, I still didn't see a refund to my credit card.  This time I checked the box asking for one of Amazon's Customer Service reps to call me, which they did, immediately. This time, my experience with Customer Service rep #2 was excellent. The gentleman who helped me out was a true pro. He researched my transaction and issued a credit to my account, which hit the next day. I would never order anything from NewVo Beauty again. Fortunately, I received excellent service from Amazon's telephone reps. Beware of NewVo Beauty. I don't believe their outstanding ratings, either."	2/16/2012

It did improve the texture of my hair. My hair is much shinier and healthier-looking than the results from my old dryer. The fly-away hairs are minimized, which is great news during a Wisconsin winter. It was not quite as heat-intensive as my previous hair dryer (also a Revlon product), which I'm guessing will also help the future health of my hair.       The buttons were a little stiff at first use, but I'm hoping they'll loosen up with more use.      This dryer was approximately the same weight as my previous dryer. It was slightly less noisy, but at a different pitch (it seemed a little higher pitched).       The only thing that prevents me from giving a five-star rating is that it seemed to take a little longer to dry my hair than with my previous dryer, which was the same wattage.       I chose this product over the Conair product because this had more options in the heat/air level settings."	11/8/2002

I had the previous model of this blow dryer and it worked very well for this purpose.  Unfortunately, after about a year the blower switch broke right in half.  I bought this one to replace it.  I like that the dryer is reasonably priced so I didn't feel too ripped off at having to buy a new one.  This one has a couple of manufacturing changes, though, that I felt were downgrades. First and foremost, this one has a 6' cord, where the previous model had a 9' cord.  The cord doesn't swivel, so the extra length gave me more flexibility in movement, whereas this one makes the dryer seem cheap.  Second, Remington changed the direction of the blower switch, rather arbitrarily, so that up is now off instead of high.  I know this sounds petty, but that change removed the automaticity of my hand movements completely and I couldn't see a good reason to change it.  It probably won't be a problem for you if you didn't have the earlier model.    The drawback to the original, which is still a drawback on the current model, is that it has so much power even in the low setting that when I'm back-brushing I don't have good control over the hair.  On the earlier model I felt this was still workable and if you want lots of blow-power this model definitely fits the bill.    I ended up coming across a BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic that I could try before buying, and even though it cost more I bought it anyway and am keeping this one as my spare.  It has the longer cord, heat and blower controls and while it has plenty of power it doesn't blow quite as hard on the low blower setting.  Since I was having to re-learn the controls on the T-Studio anyway, I figured I might as well get a longer cord out of the deal."	6/8/2011

What I liked:  -I was really drawn to the price and I still feel that it a great value.  -It has two settings; the low is nice and cool and the high is warm but not too hot. I like this because I try to use as little heat as possible.  -It has a lot of holes in the hood so it drys your hair very quickly.    -It's not as loud as I thought it would be.    What I didn't like and might also bother other users:  -I don't use rollers, but for anyone who does, this hood might be a bit small.  -I'm 5' 10 and the height is perfect for me, so if you are shorter that might be an issue. I used it at my kitchen table.  -There aren't enough holes around the back so about 3/4 way through you have to turn around with your body facing the machine. That's ultimately my biggest dislike about the machine.    Overall I'm happy with the item and I'd order it again. Hope this helps!"	2/26/2011

He is definitely less afraid of this one which is a huge plus. I use it myself and find that it doesn't take me any longer to dry my hair than usual. I also like that it is lightweight. I can't compare it to other hair dryers that claim to be super quiet. However, I would say that is misleading. It is not super quiet, but it is more quiet than our regular hair dryer. A negative for me is the placement of the control/setting buttons. They are right where I place my fingers to grip the base of the dryer and because the switch sort of softly rolls up down to change from both high-medium-low and from cool-warm-hot, I often unintentionally switch from hot to cold. I had to concentrate to hold my fingers away from the switches, away from where they would naturally rest. This hair dryer's switches should be made in such a way that they do not change so easily. A more gear-like switch (that firmly clicks and stays into separate positions) might have solved this design problem."	1/5/2006

But I've used much better, stronger dryers that cost far less. Be aware: You're paying for the label, not the performance.

My sister who has used this product and some cheap ionic one, said that she had better results with other blow-dryers.  Ionic blow-dryers give my thick hair a smoother, healthier result, but this blow-dryer does no wonders.      Blow-drying time is also not very short (I have long, semi-thick hair and it takes FOREVER to blow-dry...  air dry only takes slightly more than double the blow dry time.   Can you blame me for not liking to use this blow-dryer?).  I like the cool setting, but other than that, nothing cool.  I can't believe I invested into this blow-dryer!      On the other hand, it seems to be reliable and may last a while.... but all of my cheaper blow-dryers did last a while also (in fact, I still have them but I wanted an upgrade).    I like the separate vent cleaner.  No more clogged vents!  That feature and the easy to use cool feature make this product better than my previous cheap one.  I feel that this was a poor investment.      I have no idea how the other reviewers got great results, but my great results came with great products."	7/5/2010

My wife's habit of leaving her non-hanging dryer and tangle of cords all over the sink and vanity motivated me to get a replacement fast!    The dryer does its job -- drying -- very well.  The compact handset is easy to maneuver and it puts out a surprisingly high volume of air at the right temperature, which is a must for those with long or extra-thick hair.    This is the smallest unit of its kind I've seen.  The mounting bracket is barely wider than the dryer, which makes putting it into tight places a snap.    The relatively minor disadvantages have to do with the installation.  First, the power cord length cannot be adjusted.  It is one continuous cord from the bottom of handset, through the mounting bracket, and down to the GFCI power plug.  Some competing dryers have an electrical junction in the bracket which allows you to shorten the wire running from the bracket to the wall outlet and makes for a neater, tangle-free installation.  Second, and this is a quibble, the enclosed mounting screws and wall anchors are pretty flimsy.  I substituted a better pair I had sitting around in my toolbox.    All in all, this product does what it is supposed to very well and, despite a couple of one-time installation issues, I am very pleased with my purchase."	12/11/2007

I have a linen closet next to my vanity and there is a plug-in inside the closet.  I hang the dryer in there out of sight so when I take it out to use, it has a much longer cord then a spiral cord and I need the extra length to reach my vanity so it works perfect for me.

I did some research and found out that Bespoke will do anything to get out of a warranty for this thing. If you bought it here at Amazon they won't touch it.  Hence the circular file...    When it did work, it worked just okay. I didn't like the speeds on the fan or the heat settings. High is too high, low is too low, none of them felt quite right. Save yourself some money and buy the Remington D2012 that they sell here at Amazon. Our new one just arrived. It's got a quieter motor, absolute perfect fan speeds and heat settings, and a true 4 year warranty. Best part? You can buy almost THREE of them for the price I paid for the Bespoke.    If you are looking for a top of the line Hair Dryer then keep looking. The Bespoke has no warranty here and the product really isn't that well thought out in the first place.

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  SENT THE WRONG PART AND WON'T SEND A REPLACEMENT!!!	"I am a hair stylist and I am about to open my own salon.  There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  I did my research and ordered through Amazon because noone had ever let me down when ordering through them.  Until now.  I ordered a portable hair dryer and waited patiently for it to be delivered.  When I received it, I opened the box and began putting it together.  One of the pieces did not fit so I just thought that maybe I was doing it wrong.  After myself, my landlord, AND a maintenance man tried to put it together, we all agreed that the wrong part was delivered and that I should call customer service to ask for a replacement.  After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  WHAT??!!  I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  The customer service agent was very nice but had to relay this message to me from the manager.  So my question is...How in the world do you know if THIS piece actually fits?!  Is it possible that I received a faulty part?????  So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible hurt myself worse (it's a metal pole by the way) or send it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.  So now I am back to the start and my salon opens in less than three weeks.  Thank you, Mix Wholesale, for wasting my time."	8/1/2012

That is not a long time to evaluate it thoroughly, but it has been excellent so far.  Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little fatter than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  I think that if you use reasonable care when retracting the cord (like running the cord through your fingers as it retracts, to slow it down and straighten out any twists), it should last a long time.  I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).

"After our old dryer bit the dust, I wanted to replace it with one that worked just as well, but also quieter, lighter, and had more features.  From reading the specs and reviews on this Andis 82005 dryer, I felt this one fit the bill. But after using it for a week, I have mixed feelings. Here is why:<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Sleek looking (so what? Nice, but doesn't make your hair look any nicer)<br />2. Nice variety of attachments that stay attached nicely!<br />3. Long 10 ft. cord (if you need that, however I don't, and it really only gets in the way)<br />4. Hang loop<br />5. Dries hair fairly quickly (with Ion technology)<br />6. Outside stays cool to touch<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Heavier than the last two dryers we've had (Hot Tools Tourmaline Lite 1043 --- see my review on that one, and CHI low-EMF dryer).<br />2. Dries hair no faster than the two abovementioned ionic dryers<br />3. NOT quiet (in fact, louder than the two abovementioned dryers!)<br />4. Not enough speed/heat settings. Not much difference in heat settings, although speed settings are adequate.<br />5. Comb attachment actually hurts your scalp! Feels very scratchy, due to squared ends of the teeth.<br />6. Shiny silver-colored exterior shows prints, etc. much more than others.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad dryer... I guess I expected more. But I would probably go with another one next time."	1/15/2013

This one does the job in about 20 minutes and it is also very small and relatively light weight. From what I've looked at, this is the strongest travel-size hair dryer out there and after taking it with me on a 3 state spanning business trip I was very glad with the fact that it was half the size and much stronger than my old Solano (which, for the record, I love, but is just really large and inconvenient to lug around in a suitcase). I also love that the dryer has a loop so that I could hang it on a hook (as my bathroom doesn't have much storage space).

It comes in the ceramic/tourmaline design that is popular now, but more importantly, this dryer's wattage is much higher than most hair dryers out there (and I've looked!).  The higher the wattage, the more air it can move around...and that means faster dry times.  I've only used this a couple of times, so I don't know how long it will last.  So far, so good."	5/26/2011

It kept on tripping circuits both at my house and at other family members' homes over the holidays.       I tried to find another ion hairdryer that used less power and was surprised to find out that the standard for hairdryers now is 1875 watts. That's the equivalent of over 30, 60-watt lightbulbs!

Soft heat and light weight!	"Purchased this item because I'm needing to transition from no-lye relaxed 4b or 4c hair to natural hair. As stated, by many hair professionals of African American hair studies, that grade 4b or 4c hair is prone to dryness and needs plenty of moisture. So, I was looking to wash my hair then press it, but my hair takes hours to air dry; though, it appears dried once I towel dry it... it still retains water. Dampness effects my press iron, if my shafts are not free from vapor; therally. Well, I will be using and have used this dryer to quick dry my hair and afterwards press it. Both heat tools that I have now are of tourmaline and ceramic technology...I believe this system is better because they will ensure least harsh heat on my hair shafts. Glad that it adds shine to my hair and I look forward to continuous usage in the future. Yes, it's light weight and it's filter is easy to change.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars so far and leave off one because it's loud when set on high, but it's not bothersome (as with all dryers)."	7/25/2010

I researched a lot about hair dryers since this was my first purchase. I wanted to invest in a decent blow dryer which would last me for atleast an year. I have wavy hair and I have recently got a layer cut done with a scoop. I understood the need of a good blow dryer to get that wow look that you get after a salon visit. I must say the elchim professional 2001 truly met all my expectations. The dryer is quite light and easily manageable by blow dry virgins. If you are planning to buy a blow dryer for the first time, then i would suggest you to go for this one. This 2000 Watt dryer is very powerful and straightens your hair instantly. All you need a Ceramic Jumbo round brush ( from Brush lab) and this powerful device to create the look you have always craved for. I am really happy with the results.My husband always admires my hair now and I simply can't stop blushing...:) I  wanted a red and black combi dryer, but they sent me a black one instead. Thats Ok. When this breaks, I'm gonna simply make another purchase of the same product."	12/8/2012

I've tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so I figured I'd give this one a try.    My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    Things I like about the dryer:    1. Great heat settings.  My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I've tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I've tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it's heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I've used, I'd say it's about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you're used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I'm very satisfied.  It dried my hair quickly, can attain the heat I need (but doesn't limit you to scaldingly hot), and didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Highly recommended!"	6/14/2011

I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!<br /><br />To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.<br /><br />I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).<br /><br />The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.<br /><br />Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.<br /><br />The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.<br /><br />In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.<br /><br />Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that."	4/15/2007

It reminds me of the way hair dryers used to be designed: moderate heat but high air flow. That's the correct way to do it. (The cheap mass-market hair dryers started getting this backwards around the time they all transitioned from squirrel-cage fans to radial fans. Heating-element wire is cheaper than decent fans motors, I guess; and if that turns a hair dryer into a blowtorch, so what -- people who don't know any better will buy them anyway.)    This particular unit has a very long round cord. I can't vouch for the cord's durability, but I see no reason it wouldn't hold up. Even if it were fragile, though, I'd still want to own this hair dryer. Cords are easy to replace. I've put two on my massive GE steam iron, an old-timer from the 1960s.    In summary, then, this dryer is tough, heavy, quiet, comfortable, extraordinarily effective, and obviously built for the long haul. It is far, far above anything I've seen in the stores since squirrel-cage motors disappeared some years ago."	6/15/2008

I will say that the cord is very sturdy, which was a concern from other reviewers. My previous hairdryer was the Chi Turbo Professional, and it lasted about 5 years. I don't like this hairdryer as much as my Chi, and I've had it long enough (3 months) to get used to it. It isn't super quiet like some reviews said, and it doesn't dry my hair any faster than my Chi. Also, the front of the nose (before the black attachment) gets VERY hot and you can't hold it. I like to hold my hairdryers at the nose when I am drying the front of my hair, but now I can't. I'll definitely keep this hairdryer until it's time to get a new one, but it didn't impress me. It still gets 3 stars because it isn't a BAD hairdryer, but also it's nothing special."	1/9/2012

It does dry my hair faster and it is quieter compared to my old 30 dollar dryer.  The only con is that it is heavier than my old dryer.  I'm a little concerned about how it was packaged.  It looks like the item was opened and then repackaged.  Each piece inside the box was repackaged and closed with twisty ties.  Hopefully I won't have any problems with it and it will last.  I would recommend this dryer to anyone who has thick hair and a lot of it!	8/17/2010

It's much quieter than most dryers I've used, which is great, because I always worry about damaging my hearing with daily use. So it's great not having to have to worry about that.    Some people talk about how heavy it feels, but I don't really notice. I do visit the gym every once in while, so there you go.    I thought the silvery front part of the dryer was going to be metal, but it's a dull plastic. That makes it look quite a bit cheaper than pictured. It still works great nonetheless. It dries faster than my other dryer. I really like all of the settings; warm/hot (and cool button), low/high. As far as the shininess - I didn't notice a difference. But I definitely had less static and fly-aways.     It comes with a diffuser and another part which you can snap on, which I'm pretty sure is for blowing your hair out.      All in all, this hair dryer is a good deal for the price. I think it's cheaper here on Amazon than Walmart. At my Wally, there were selling it for $20 and I got it for $10 here."	12/22/2008

Drys hair very fast with no frizz - even in Winter. Liked the first one so much I bought a second.<br /><br />UPDATE: I thought it worth updating this review, as it has been nearly 5 years since I purchased two of these dryers, and they are still going strong with daily use! One of the things that I have come to really appreciate about this dryer is that the low fan setting truly is low. So many other dryers give you high and higher as choices. I don't want to achieve the head out the car window look, I want just enough airflow to get the job done. Of course, there is a high setting if you do want more. The other noteworthy thing is that cleaning lint out of the dryer is so easy! The lint screen removes very easily and can be cleaned in seconds and replaced. This helps keep the unit working efficiently and adds to its life."	2/6/2007

"I used this hairdryer while on a trip to Ireland.  While it's true that you only get one functioning speed when using the dryer with 240 volts, the speed you have is very powerful.  I stayed at a number of hotels that had dryers available, but in most cases, I used this one instead.  This gave me the convenience of using it anywhere in the room and had more power than those supplied by the hotels.  It is very light weight and compact for packing.  I would definitely recommend this to others who want to be certain they have a functioning hair dryer while in European countries without having to purchase and take the risk of using a convertor.  A plug adapter is still necessary.  A simple turn of a screw using your fingernail changes the dryer from 120-240 volts."	10/16/2012

I used it primarily on the warm setting applying the tension method to my (4b/4c) hair and it was fine. I accidentally had it on the hot setting initially and that was too much heat for my hair.

In my opinion it is not much different than the other wavers that are not described as DEEP wavers. I do hold Hot Tools brand in high regard from owning their products for numerous years. I would definitely take this deep waver over the other regular wavers, but wish I wouldn't have invested more money into the same kind of thing, more or less.

"I have WHITE blonde eyelashes and eyebrows. I never leave home without mascara (yeah, okay, and a little lipgloss, too. I'm vain). I found so much FREEDOM in using this product!

It was easy & fast to use -- start to finish, including clean up, it took maybe 10 minutes. If it's messy for you, you're using too much of the gel at one time. The trick is to make sure you use the 1st chemical several times and allow it to soak through the hair's cuticle. Once that's done, it's just a matter of barely touching your lashes with the colorant gel and presto! Dark lashes!      Ladies, it only COLORS your existing lashes, it doesn't make them longer or thicker.  If you take your time and apply it carefully, you can get it to go from the base to the tips of your lashes.  I colored my lashes about 3 weeks ago, and it's still going strong.  I'll probably do a touch up in another week or so. I'm very happy with this product. I wish I'd found it 20 years ago.  I can't imagine not having this in my beauty arsenal. Now that I've discovered it, I'll never be without it again."	8/5/2010

I invested a couple hours researching on line and reviewing the products here at Amazon. In the end, I selected the Conair Ion Shine because it was 1875 watts, was an ionizer, was priced affordably, and the design seemed good.<br /><br />Now that I have received the item and have had some time to use it, here are my ratings:<br />STORABILITY: 2.5 stars  There is a hanging loop, but  the cord is heavy and awkward. The unit is heavy enough that whatever hook one would hang it from would have to be substantially mounted so it would not pull out of the wall. (Wall mounting is not an option for me). Also, after only two uses, the cord has already begun to twist, which is a negative.<br />VALUE: 4.5 stars  I knew the Amazon price was reasonable, even lower than my local discount stores. After I purchased this item,  I found the same model at BIG LOTS for a dollar more and in different colors.<br />PERFORMANCE:  5 stars  Dries hair quickly without using high heat temps. Unit comes with a few attachments. The diffuser is really large and awkward to store. The unit has a hinged filter that opens easily for cleaning. The removable filter is the standard small piece of material that I have seen in other high-tech fan devices, including the high-end SmartTechnologies Smart Board in my classroom. I'm figuring the filter material is pretty standard. In my previous hair dryer, the fan did not have a removable filter for cleaning; eventually the old fan clogged so horribly (despite my attempts to brush it out)that it slowed down and eventually killed the unit.<br /><br />Other note: If a younger child will be using the unit, she may find the unit feels heavy or hard to hold after a while. I suggest looking for one of the smaller, portable units for tweens."	3/28/2011

I liked the way it made my hair look: soft, shiny and without frizz.  Although this newer version of the Ion Shine hairdryer should have improved on the preceding models, it falls short of my older version.  The switches, which respond to very little pressure, are placed directly where I want to put my hand and it is inevitable that I end up accidentally switching the hairdryer off or changing the heat setting.  The hairdryer is also a bit unwieldy if one wants to use the extensions.  On the plus side, it speedily dries my hair and leaves it as shiny as my previous Ion Shine."	3/21/2007

"So since this isn't sold by amazon, I'm mainly reviewing the seller (Wish4Star).<br /><br />I received this order in a timely fashion (it's shipped standard USPS and so took a few days... maybe 5 or so). All the items in the pic showed up and the packaging was compact and secure.<br /><br />However, upon going through all the razors (great selection of blades BTW), I noticed that one box had been opened and a razor had been opened! Yuck!! So I contacted the seller and he assured me this had never happened before (I have a feeling he's telling the truth) and that he would send me a new box asap. Well I just received my replacements (yeah he sent an extra pack!), which showed up quite quickly.<br /><br />So all in all I trust this seller & had a very positive experience with him.

It wasn't as powerful as I like and the opening for the air coming out seems to be larger than my last dryer, so it just goes all over the place instead of being more focused.  The thing I'm most unhappy with is the cord.  I always buy dryers that have the retractable cord because I can't stand having to deal with the cord getting wrapped around everything in my drawer.  Every other dryer that I've had the cord goes all the way into the dryer just leaving the plug hanging out.  This dryer has about a foot or more of cord still hanging.  It is just a pain deal with the dangling cord while putting it in and out of the drawer every day.  I'm still deciding if I should return it or not."	12/7/2012

It is nice that the GFI is built into the unit and not on the plug so that the plug does not block an outlet or have to plug into the bottom outlet only. I recommend this product.

After a couple uses I noticed the smell of burning hair and thought maybe it was a little too hot but my hair seemed fine so I didn't really worry about it.  Then I began to notice after I showered and started to comb my wet hair a lot more hair than normal was falling out.  It was falling out in thick strands which has never happened to me before.  I thought maybe it was stress or horomones since I recently had a baby but the more I used the dryer I realized the intense heat was burning off and damaging my hair!  Even now that I've stopped using it my hair is still fragile from the dryer and still comes out in clumps after I shower.  Please stay away from this dryer!  I'm glad mine never shot sparks like the other reviews I saw but it doesn't surprise me."	5/20/2008

I researched many sites and brands before I purchased this hair dryer. I must admit I was initially attracted to the red color but then was impressed with the other attributes. My hair is relatively short and fine. I need a dryer to help give my hair body and this one does it very well. I like the attatchment that can be used as a comb since it can be used with one hand; I recently had elbow surgery so this enables me to dry my hair with one hand.

The bristles just squish out and do not stay stiff enough to work hair. I think the boars bristles would be even worse with thick hair. They need a stiff nylon brush option.  They also need a medium speed for drying. You get slow low and fast high and if you can hold your finger on the quick heat button then maybe you can get to medium heat and blowing speed from the low setting but you can't hold the button for long. There should be some sort of trigger with the quick heat button built in or a way to lock it down. I don't use the other two attachments. I'd swap them for two different brushes or one good stiff brush attachment.	5/24/2009

"I have thick hair that is almost to the bottom of my lower back (or top of my bottom, lol).

I love that it has the Ionic  capability and the cool air, to help decrease the frizzie's and keep my hair style set. Not that hair that long has much style.    It did come with attachments that I have no idea what their purpose is, so those are kind of a waste.    I was initially concerned the first few days because the temp. seemed to be fluctuating, however after a few uses it smoothed out. The cord is really long, which is great because the only outlet I have in my bathroom has ruined several blow dryers by melting the plug.

Honestly, I've used this product (in combination with additional regrowth methods) and am receiving results that I have not had in the past using other regrowth combinations (I've used this 15% solution for roughly 5-6 months).

How could a thing that blows air do all that?   I knew I needed to look for something new though because after using my old blow dryer, my medium thick, wavy, frizzy fly-away hair was not presenting itself in a pretty way but just looking worse and worse.  Any grade of shampoo and conditioner didn't seem to make a big difference overall.    It got to be where I just dreaded the task of doing my hair.    After using this Conair dryer one time, my crown of glory was good enough to go as-is if I didn't have time to use the flat iron.  This is a 100% improvement over my old-no-special-features blow dryer which has been retired to probably dry pets and mittens and boots or whatever.  Now after using this Conair almost daily for about a month, I wish I had learned about the technology way sooner and saved myself a lot of angst over how to tame my hair.   I love this blow dryer and that it came with three attachments (I don't know which I like best), that it is light weight, has a sufficient length cord, dries my hair quickly, isn't overly loud, and most of all that I can SEE that my hair is in better condition."	9/5/2007

I get so tired of trying out skincare products made for combination skin (normal/oily). Face creams for dry skin is just too much moisture and oil for my type of skin. Finding good all natural skincare is even harder. I use Pangea Organics line for the day time. I use this oil for night because I wake up with very oily and very dry skin. Using this actually helps reduce this and makes my skin feel so much softer. It's hard for me blend this oil on my face alone without using more than 2 drops. So, I mix this in with my Pangea Organics face lotion at night and wake up with refreshed-looking skin. I haven't tried using this oil in the day time since I get the midday oil slick, but I hear Argan Oil reduces the oiliness without drying the skin. Here's another bonus, my skin tend to get flushed in the afternoon, like as if I just ran a marathon. Using this Argan Oil reduced the redness.     One of the reviewer says it might not be pure because it is fragrance free, instead will try one that has the fragrance. I don't doubt this is product is of lesser quality because the information supplied by Slice of Nature says that there are 3 processing types for Argan oil. One of them is make Argan oil fragrance free and most of the time comes out clear. The other type of processing keeps the fragrance and the color is yellow or darker AND it is mostly used for cooking, maybe for cosmetics. I personally don't want to put cooking oil on my skin, since cooking oil can go rancid very quickly. That's like saying that I will put grapeseed cooking oil for my body. Would you do this? This one from Watt's Beauty is clear and it is contained in a very simple and plain brown bottle with a dropper, which is very useful.     As always with any consumer products, it's always either you like it or you don't. I personally like this and will continue to use it.    I haven't tried using this on my hair or on my body. My hair is pretty normal. I do intend on using this with my body lotion very soon."	8/5/2010

I've always wanted a simple solution to great hair and this is exactly it. I used to own a Conair from the drug store and this Sedu has changed my perspective on hair dryers. I've always thought that I can never re-produce the kind of blow out that I get from salons but this hair dryer has made it possible. The air is pretty strong and I don't find the hair dryer heat up more than my drug store one. It does take most of the frizz away and my hair stays in a nice curve for the whole day when I use a round brush.<br /><br />To be fair though, this hair dryer more expensive so you would expect the higher quality to match the price tag. Another thing I found is that it's actually kinda heavy for its size. My old one is bigger but actually weight about the same as this one, maybe even less. If you are looking for a feather weight, maybe this is not for you. Other than that, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Loving it so far!"	6/28/2012

It's a far shorter task with this dryer, and neither of us end up sweating.     Re comments about the attachments not staying on the nozzle. I duly noted that, and therefore it did not frustrate me when I found that was sometimes the case. We're not big attachment users, and I know where the duct tape is!

After researching many available on Amazon and other websites, I chose the Andis model because it offered the nighlight and a place for the cord. I've been using it now for two months.     Since it was going to take up a permanent spot in my outlet, it having a nightlight was dead useful.  I read other reviews saying that the nightlight was way too bright.  My husband and I disagree. We love the amount of light put out by the hairdryer.  It is signficantly brighter than our old nightlight which means you can get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and never have to turn on the overhead light.  Isn't that the point of a nightlight?  Maybe the people who dislike the amount of light have it in a master bath and don't close the door to the bathroom and it bothers them when they sleep? My solution would be to shut the bathroom door in that case!    Sorry that this turned into a review of the nightlight feature!  The hairdryer gives you as 1400 or 1600 watt option and I use it on the 1600 because I have massively thick hair.  It dries my hair quickly and is not obnoxiously loud.  I like that it has a cord keeper and keeps everything tidy in my teeny bathroom.  My husband had the hairdryer mounted on the wall in less than 10 minutes and that includes my running up and down the stairs for the right screwdriver.    All in all, an excellent buy and I would purchase it again."	4/15/2011

Every family needs one!<br /><br />3/30/3013  I wish to change my review after using this product!  I bought 2 of these dryers in Sept 2011.  One was replaced under warranty after 6 months.  Both of them have now quit (one was used for 18 months, the other for 1 year).  In both cases the dryer was being used at low speed when it sudddenly smelled hot and switched to high speed.  The low speed switch apparently burned out.  I am not sure they are really safe to use after the burn smell.  I also do not like the high speed for drying my hair!  My previous wall mount dryers (both a different brand) lasted over 10 years each.  I feel this product quality is not good considering the short life of the product.  These dryers were used only about twice a week.  My dryers in the past were used daily and by a large family, so these Andis ones definitely did not last well."	10/25/2011

"I ordered the product about two weeks ago. Shipping was fast, the product came in a plain box and was well packaged.

I got some of the solution on the surrounding skin but applied the ointment to stop the burn. The solution burns the skin very quickly so you have to be carefuly not to apply too much. The burns has caused my skin to become discolored, my neck now looks worse than before and my tags haven't fallen off yet. That was a week ago, so I will now use a small brush to apply and hopefully this will prove a better applicator than the q-tip.

But I expected something a lot more impressive from the reviews given.<br /><br />On a plus side, it does have good heat.<br /><br />I also thought that the air flow would be solved with that front clamp thingy (the front thingy that pushes the air flow in a very specific direction) but NO! Actually the air feels more dispersed with the front clamp thing. Wha??<br /><br />I guess this comes down to the fact that you get what you pay for. But sometimes I have paid very little and have gotten a whole lot. This was not the case.<br /><br />Mostly, I really wish the reviews would have matched the quality of this product.<br /><br />Disappointed and I would NOT suggest people to purchase this dryer unless you're really looking for a meh whatever kind of dryer with a good cheap price."	11/20/2012

"My hair dryer finally died after - well, I'm not sure how old it was... maybe 25 years?  Read many of the reviews on this and decided to give it a try.  EXCELLENT hair dryer; it has a cooling button to set the curl which I forgot about.  The first time I used it I styled half my head and suddenly remembered this button - which is actually very easy to use, takes less than 10 secs - the first time I tried it the curl was definitely MUCH better then what I had just using the heat.  I had to go back and redo the first half and was so pleased.  The blow dry was excellent; it didn't fall during the day; the bounce was still in my hair the next day (after sleeping on it).<br /><br />I never had this good a blow dry with any of my older dryers, so the new construction really does make a difference.  Dried my hair in half the time.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4-stars is the design of the handle.  It's much narrower than my old dryer, making it difficult to handle and difficult to get to the cooling button.  I'm hoping I get used to it over time because it kinda keeps slipping in my hand."	6/16/2012

"For the last couple of months I have researched and read reviews of every hair dryer imaginable on every website imaginable and finally settled on this hair dryer.  And I couldn't be happier!!!  My hair is:    1). Straight  2). Smooth  3). NOT Frizzy  4). Shiny  5). Volumous  6). Looks like I just got a blow out at a salon    Let me start at the beginning.  My hair is shoulder length, somewhere between curly and wavy, tends to be dry and frizzes very easily.  I am typically a slave to the flat iron, but no more.  Here is what I did, step by step to achieve my best hair day ever (that I have done myself- no salon styling included).    1). I washed and conditioned my hair, as usual  2). After towel drying my hair, I used a wide tooth comb to smooth it out and put a dollop of leave in conditioner on the ends.  I then let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes while I putzed around the house.  3). I sectioned my hair and clipped up any hair I was not blow drying at the time.    4). On each section I was drying I put a tiny dot of straightening cream and worked it through my hair.  5). Using a 1.25 round natural bristle brush, I blew each section dry with a downward motion of the brush and dryer.  As I was done with each section, I clipped it away and worked with one section at a time.  It got a little awkward in the back, but I figured I would touch up with the flat iron at the end.  6). There was no need for touching up!  My hair came out great.  I used a dollop of shine wax when I was done drying and shaped my hair.  I finished with a spritz of hair spray.      Even if this hair dryer broke after one use, I would shell out the cash to get another one.  It is that worth it.  I did not have any problems with the buttons that some people said and I did not think it was too heavy to work with either.  What can I say?  I love this hair dryer and I would give it 10 stars!"	8/5/2010

I liked the fact that it was mounted and had the night light. It was never the most powerful hairdryer but I generally only dry my bangs and just fluff the water off the top of the curls, so I wasn't that worried about it. If I was pulling and straightening my hair every day, this would not have been enough power. That said, it worked fine for what I needed. However, today it started to spark. This is not hard wired, its just a plug in model. I was pretty surprised because it gave no other indication that it was wearing out. I would expect most hair dryers that are used lightly to last longer than this. Too bad.     Considering the higher price tag for the wall mounted version and the short life of the product, I would not buy it again."	6/8/2010

As someone who largely believes in science, I am very well aware that pheromones DO exist. I've also always wondered what it would be like to wear these pheromones. After exhausting the internet, it seemed that all I could find were pheromones catering to heterosexual men. Then I found this, and again, believing that it would work, I bought it.    Unfortunately, after using it for a few days now, I do not notice any differences in the way people (gay/straight/male/female) interact with me. They have however taken notice to the scent, and they love the scent, but I see no noticeable sexual excitement in other gay men, or increased mood and friendliness of straight men.    Soooo, it is now my belief, that the synthesized pheromone technology does not work in this cologne.

So I researched a little, saw that this one got pretty good reviews, and bought it.  It's a decent price, not too heavy, and after less than 10 minutes, my thick, below the shoulder, layered hair was completely dry.  And it looked like i'd just come back from getting my hair done.  Amazing.  My hair feels soft and silky.  I had no problems with accidentally turning the switches on or off (honestly I don't see how you could unless your fingers wrap all the way around the handle), my arm didn't get tired (you're only holding it for less than ten minutes, when does it have time to get tired?!), and air stream is pretty strong.      My only problem is that my hair looked a little dry, and the dryer didn't look THAT professional, but those are minor issues.    Overall, I'm a fan."	11/25/2007

The problem is that they don't last. The night light in the white one went out on the second day. The night light in the black one went out on the third day. After I drilled the holes to mount them, I didn't really want to bother with the hassle to return them since the hair dryers both work fine.  I'm pretty sure I saw a cheaper version of these without the night light, and that's what I'd recommend. I'm used to a bit more wind from my regular dryer (at three times the size) but these dryers still complete the job in about the same amount of time.  The ones I received DO have the coiled cord, exactly like the picture (some say they received straight cords) and it turns off automatically when you return the dryer to the holder.  My only complaints are the night lights going out (of course) and the fact that you can't remove the dryer from the holder to pack in a suitcase, which is a shame because they are very small and would be great for travel if you could.  All in all I'm happy with the purchase."	10/22/2011

I mean huge.  Now maybe it's because this baby is an 1875 watt job and all our other current and prior hair dryers are 1600 or less.  When it is open, it is bigger than any other hair dryer we have ever owned.  When it is closed (folded, for &#34;travel&#34; -- heh, like this would handily fit in a suitcase) this thing is almost as big as my dopp (shaving bag).  Fortunately we travel more by ground so we don't worry much about suitcase space.<br /><br />And, as others have mentioned, the cord does not reel in all the way without help or retries.  We can live with that.  Even once the cord is stored, the cordstop leaves about a foot of cord out.  It wasn't a surprise because other reviewers have mentioned this too.<br /><br />On the plus side it does dry hair quickly.  FYI, all the girls in our family have long thick hair.<br /><br />A very important feature this dryer has -- and a major reason I chose it -- is that it does have a &#34;medium&#34; heat setting.  (Most just have high and low, with low being very low.)  The reason &#34;medium&#34; is important, especially on a high wattage unit, is that &#34;high&#34; can blow circuit breakers.  If you don't whether you have 20amp service on an outlet, you may really want the medium setting.  (Ever try to get a hotel to reset your breaker while your wife's hair is wet?)  The &#34;medium&#34; setting dries hair just fine.  The high setting dries hair scary fast, but I'm not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run, but it is nice to have when you're in a hurry.<br /><br />A word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel:  always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need.  I don't know if it tells you that in the manual but it's always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot.  From staring at this unit, it is possible the hair dryer draws the cold intake air across the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right."	12/22/2012

As long as you sit in the right chair and use the right table, it's not too bad, and have plenty to do. I got this to free my hands for other things sometimes, and I'm going to use it more now that it's recommended over hand-held dryers because it's less damaging to hair. I just have my hair down instead of rollers for faster drying, but going to start wrapping my hair so it won't be as frizzy. It takes about an hour to dry my hair. I'm sure it would be about the same if I used an 1875 wattage one. I would recommend it if you have the patience to sit under a dryer and have things to occupy your time with."	8/21/2007

"I was looking for an Ionic drier because of how quick it manages my medium length hair. I wasn't worried about compact or travel.<br /><br />It feels heavy enough to be quality, but not too heavy to use. The settings are good, although I expected a little more power from the high blower setting - but with the ionic tech it doesn't need to blow harder.<br /><br />The cool blast button doesn't react as quickly as turning the heat setting to low.<br /><br />For function, it's perfectly fine, no complaints with function.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like which is a &#34;feature&#34;, is the soft matte finish.  It's pretty when it's new, but it gets scuffed and smudged with styling products and isn't pretty.  I'm not one to clean my styling appliances so often but this one needs a wipe down more often than not. It's not terrible, but I don't like it, and it wasn't an issue with my former drier.<br /><br />There are so many products out there which are comparable, it's really hard to decide. I'm not 'super excited', but I'm happy."	1/12/2013

However, I bought it because I had several expections about its features.  Here is how each feature measured up:<br />Quicker?  NO.  It may even take a little longer than a standard 1875-watt dryer.  The reason is that the fan does not blow very hard.  The high setting blows about like the low setting on a standard dryer.<br />Reduced frizz/flyaways/static? YES.  These are significantly reduced.<br />Increased shine?  YES.  My hair is visibly shinier.<br />Quieter?  YES, but qualified.  The only reason it is quieter is because it doesn't blow air as hard as a regular dryer.<br />Freshens hair?  YES.  <br />Another drawback:  This dryer is very heavy.  It took me several days to get used to how heavy it is.<br />This dryer delivers almost all of what ionic hairdryers promise, but I was mostly hoping for a dryer to speed drying time.  If you have thin hair or hair that dries quickly or have plenty of time to dry your hair, then I would highly recommend this dryer.  My hair looks shinier and healthier."	3/2/2002

It's not often that you can find one that is suited for both curly and straight styles.  The air diffusing attachment is perfect for creating soft, frizz free curls while the concentrator nozzle (more narrow and therefore a better conductor of air than most models with this feature) allows you to direct air exactly where you want it.  The dryer itself features two speed (low and high) and three heat settings (cool, warm and hot), as well as a cold shot button to lock in style.  For the highest heat setting, simply put the dryer on high speed and the hottest setting (careful, though...this is only recommended for hair that's UBER curly, like mine).  Additionally, the 9 foot long cord (complete with a loop that will allow you to hook it onto something in your bathroom or wherever else you store it) makes it really easy to use.  Another bonus: even on the highest setting, the dryer is considerably more quiet than other ones on the market that are similarly priced (you can easily hold a conversation while speaking in a normal tone of voice). <br /> <br />According to the information that's included with the product, the dryer is made with a combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology that allows for a special emission of ions (these are important for eliminating static electricity).  I found that after use, my hair actually was a lot smoother even than when I used previous hair dryers with ionic technology; I used it to style my hair both in its naturally curly state and after setting it in rollers to blow dry it straight.  If your hair is really curly like mine, however, you might still want to use a flatiron to get that pin-straight look.  But for less curly hair or hair that's less prone to frizz, that probably won't be necessary. <br /> <br />Although this is by far my favorite hair dryer I've ever owned, I do agree with the previous comment on this product: it really would be the perfect dryer if it had a folding handle.  But this is only a tiny flaw, as it more than makes up for that missing feature with its humidity resisting technology.  Well done, Remington.  An invaluable product for any styling arsenal."	11/5/2006
