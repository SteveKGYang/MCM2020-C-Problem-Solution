We bought small packs of three different types of pacifiers to see what our baby would prefer.  We bought Dr Brown's Prevent, Nuk, and Avent.  Our baby will LOVES the Dr Brown pacifiers.  She'll put up with the Avent ones, but they pop out of her mouth so easily it's hardly worth it.  The Nuk ones get spit out almost instantly, they're too hard to keep in her mouth.  These ones have a fantastic shape that is very well designed.  I love that it doesn't give her gas because she's not sucking any air.  These are just so perfectly designed and we've already bought more for her.  I think it's good advice to try different pacifiers for your baby because all babies are different, but I will say that these ones definitely stay in their mouths better no matter who your baby is - so I won't tell you not to try different pacifiers at first, but definitely include these when you're trying a few out!  They'll probably become a quick favorite for you and baby.<br /><br />Originally we purchased the Dr Browns Prevent pacifiers from another Amazon listing where Colors may vary and there are no handles on the pacifier.  We ended up with blue and red, which I didn't love for our little girl.  It's silly and not important, but I didn't love having her suck on a blue or red pacifier when she was always dressed in pink or purple.  These pacifiers are much preferred!  Though they're the same shape for sucking, there are a few differences.  The silly difference (but it matters to me!) of the color is the obvious difference.  Another key difference is these ones also have the handles on them and the others don't.  I have found that I much prefer the handles for multiple reasons.  One, they are easy to hold if I'm burping her and just want to have the pacifier handy for when she's done and ready for it.  Two, if I drop the pacifier, the extra weight from the handle makes it land on the back almost every time so the nipple doesn't get dirty.  Three, if you're attaching a pacifier clip, it can attach to the handle instead of the opening on the part of the pacifier that touches the baby's face.  Our pacifier clip was always rubbing against our baby's face when using the other ones and I didn't like that since it left a red mark on her cheek.<br />Another difference is that these pacifiers actually come with a clip-on nipple cover.  I LOVE this accessory because if I'm running to a neighbor's house for a short visit and I don't need to tote a whole diaper bag, but I do want to bring a pacifier - I easily can with the clip cover.  It works so great to just clip the cover on so I can throw the pacifier in my pocket without it getting all nasty.  Or it's nice for putting in the diaper bag without getting gross as well.<br /><br />The price is about the same (within a dollar) of the other colors may vary listing, so these ones are the clear winner between the two listings.  If you want a great pacifier for your little girl, these are PERFECT!"	4/9/2013

I have used this product since my son was just a few months old.  I loved it.  I never worried about the seat belt again.  I was in a car accident with my child when he was almost 3 years old.  I was still using this product with his forward facing car seat.  My car was totalled (I drove a Saturn)...the only part of the car without damage was the roof & the drivers side...my son's car seat was on the rear passenger side, so he recieved more of the impact than I did being the driver.  I honestly believe that this  product saved him from worse injuries than he recieved.  He came out of the wreck with only scratches on the top of his head.  Even though the Mighty-Tite makes the seat belt tight so that the car seat itself won't slide around, his car seat still fell over & that is what shielded his body & face from the glass.  I don't know how it worked out that way, but if his car seat hadn't fallen to its side, I think that he may have been hurt more.  The Mighty-Tite still worked fine after the wreck, & the seat belt never broke like some of the other reviews say.  My son is now in a booster seat & we don't use the Mighty-Tite anymore, but I am pregnant with my 2nd child, I am definately going to use this product again with this baby."	4/7/2005

What more can you ask for?  I give them a little extra charge by holding them up to the light for a minute, which my daughter for some reason finds hysterically funny.

"My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth.  I frantically purchased several look-a-likes when we came home.  Even at the her tender age of just a few months old, she was not to be fooled by these silly knock-offs.  I had a diva on my hands and she wanted nothing less than the real thing.  I finally discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. Finally we were saved!<br /><br />During my search for the holy grail of pacifiers, I came across these wubanubs and bought them mostly because they were super cute.  And since I was starting a collection of pacifiers, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try.  Love, love, love these.  And my daughter does as well.<br /><br />First let me begin by saying that the pacifier, on these precious dolls, are practically identical to the make and material of the hospital variety and perfect for my little one.  They are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night.  My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth.  I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown.  I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier.<br /><br />Although, they are a little pricier than a traditional pacifier...you save money by not having to purchase another two pack because you don't know where the gazillion others you purchased went.  I have yet to lose even one of these.  They also make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It appears to be a somewhat  meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib.  So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills and actually pacify.<br />There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that this one along with the Tabby cat is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush; however, I have cut the pacifier out of just one after its seen some wear.  ( Just as a caution.)  Once you stitch the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with, unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket.  I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free."	8/30/2012

This product certainly did the trick. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because when we first got it, she found it a bit difficult to get the actual pacifier part in her mouth. This is because the paci is attached to a little piece of fabric (rather than directly onto the caterpiller), so it's wobbly. Now that she's older and has better dexterity with her fingers, it's no problem. I've also discovered that using this has helped her learn how to get her pacifiers without the attached animal in her mouth, too."	4/24/2011

"I was told about Wubbanubs by another mother in a store who saw me struggling to keep my little girl's paci in her mouth. She told me they are suppose to hold the paci in place and keep it from falling out of the babies mouth even if they stop sucking. She said the feet were weighted to hold the whole thing on the chest of the baby. It sounded perfect, especially for the car seat and when my little girl is laying on her back. Unfortunately, there are many things wrong with this product. First of all, the pacifier is permanently attached to the stuffed animal and can not be removed to be cleaned properly. The weighted feet have a few little bean bag beads in them which do not keep it still at all. As soon as my daughter moves even slightly, the thing pulls right out of her mouth. Even when she's asleep, She has to lay perfectly still to keep it in her mouth...as soon as she moves her head, it comes out and she wakes up. At least with a regular pacifier, when she lets go of it, it falls away from her face. With this, when it comes out, its still in her face and sticks her until she gets frustrated and starts crying... If it doesn't keep the paci in the babies mouth, I'm not really sure what good it is..."	4/26/2013

"I first bought these when I again had to replace the 12 pacifiers that had gone missing. My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The tabby kitten is my favorite.  I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free."	4/28/2012

I didn't want to have the problem of having to keep putting it back in for him to sleep. However, we found a happy medium in using them. They really are a great transitional piece. What I mean is if you are in the car and he's hungry and you need to buy 10-15 minutes to get home to nurse, letting him suck on the pacifier will keep him from a total meltdown. It also is invaluable if he has missed his sleep window and needs the soothing of sucking to settle him down. We tried the other kind that has the wider rubber piece, but I found it would make him gag. I bought these at the grocery store late one night when we were desperate and couldn't find our others and this one was hospital recommended. They are a good pacifier. A few drawbacks to me is the little handle can be awkward and the breathing holes aren't very big. Having said that he had a easier time using this one than any others and the nipple wasn't too big for him as a newborn. Now we only use it occasionally when we need to buy some time to get home and he's hungry or tired.

"we love these bottles.  we had to find an alternative to glass bottles with removable rubber sleeves because our daycare was worried about shattering glass if they were dropped.  with these, there is no risk of shattering glass at all.  and we like them better than the removable sleeves because no water gets trapped between the sleeve and bottle, which can be messy and annoying.  plus, our removable sleeves, by evenflo were constantly breaking. the only negative about these bottles is that the ounce markers are extremely hard to read, especially when filled with milk.  the price is excessively high so we are managing with only three bottles for daycare.  wish the price would go down so we could afford more."	12/10/2009

However, he arrived 5 weeks early and with a very weak sucking reflex, so we have used these to help teach him how to suck.  The hospital had the soothie type pacifiers, but my son never figured out that he was supposed to suck on it.  It seemed too stiff for his weak suck reflex. Compared to the MAM pacifiers we used with my older son, I like the design of these much better.  They seem to fit better in my son's mouth, especially being much smaller.<br /><br />We initially used them right before I would breastfeed him to get him practice sucking and then quickly transfer him to the breast.  In addition, we have used them for very brief periods of time (like diaper changes or baths) when he gets very upset, as he tends to gulp air and then spit up more.<br /><br />Since my son was premature and is just now breastfeeding well, we are slowly using these less and less, but will likely reintroduce them when he is a little older.<br /><br />My only complaint so far is that I had no idea what colors we would be receiving.  I was actually hoping for more gender neutral and we ended up with bright primary colors that would have worked for a boy or a girl, but some color selections would be nice.  I really appreciate that these don't have gendered pictures or sayings on them."	6/7/2012

No worries, the first one is still going strong - our family has grown and we needed another bag and based on our experience with this car seat travel bag, we did not even hesitate buying one more.   First of all, the material is much thicker and stronger than I originally expected. It holds up well and is easy to wipe clean. The straps are nice and strong, and my husband swears they are comfortable too - he does most of the hauling. It sits well on your back (just the right spot) on an average height person but even a petite woman like me can't complain and I'm barely 5 feet tall.   We were trying to choose between a bag with straps vs. bag with wheels and are really glad we went with straps.

"These are nice and soft and do conform well to her face without the marks left by hard backed pacis. However she does have trouble sucking on the round paci bit. She seems to have more luck with the flat pacis which may just be due to the fact she breastfeeds. However if your little one is used to sucking on a regular round nippled bottle these would probably work fine. Overall I think they are worth purchasing if your baby can suck on them. They aren't really soft,they conform to babys face nicely,and they work well and keep her content when she can manage them."	12/13/2011

"My daughter refuses to eat more than an ounce or so every few hours, even when she was starving (been like that since she was born, she actually refused to eat the first 72 hours. Guess she never really caught onto the whole sucking thing) and would not accept any type of pacifier(like many parents we bought every pacifier on the market). That was until a friend told us they had a similar dilema and bought us a pack to try out. She absolutely loves them! They are perfect hold overs for until she really wants to eat.    These pacifiers are one piece and without the plastic guard. The advantage to this is that it reduces the chances of nasties lurking in the seams/cracks of where the plastic joins the nipple from improper washing or not sterilizing. Unless you are disassembling your childs two piece pacifier(plastic from nipple) and cleaning it, you're not cleaning it as well as your tell yourself.    Some  perhaps your child shouldn't be using them. These are NEWBORN PACIFIERS as stated on the package. If your child is not a NEWBORN then it's probably best to move onto other pacifiers more appropriately sized for your child. Everyone is different but I have a hard time believing a NEWBORN(as these are made for NEWBORNS) can swallow the entire pacifier. I've tried and had trouble myself.    Other complaints about the lack of 'bulbing' at the tip of the pacifier which makes it difficult for the newborn to hold in it's mouth is nothing more than laziness. Pay your child more attention. If your child is sucking her thumb(or mittens, sleeves, blankie, what have you) then she/he is  either hungry or wants comfort. If you're sticking a pacifier in a NEWBORNs mouth just so you don't have to listen to them cry, it's probably a good time to rethink your methods of raising a child. A pacifier is a great way to comfort or help increase her appetite(we used these to increase her appetite and get her in the habit of sucking so she would eat more) but should not be used simply as adistraction so you don't have to deal with them.     Lastly, people say these are ugly as sin. I agree, but your child doesn't care:) Just like all the decorations or excessive amount of money you can spend on newborn clothing, your child does not care.    If it works, it work. Every child is different. For our kid that had trouble grasping the 'sucking' motions for the first few months(whether it was breastfeeding or the Playtex slow flow latex wide nipples which are the absolute slowest nipples around!), these helped her become strong and healthy!"	3/21/2010

(only put 4 stars because i really do think they should expand their line to fit more cribs... or, more specifically, be detailed enough so the customers don't waste time getting a product that might not fit their crib very well)."	11/12/2011

"I love the way this little dragon looks, and it's always easy to find the baby's pacifier.  However, I do not feel that it helps our little guy keep the pacifier in his mouth at all.  He's only 2 months old and was a preemie, so he has difficulty holding onto a paci regardless.  The soothie and gumdrop pacifiers are the only ones recommended by lactation professionals for nursing babies, so I feel like if you have to use one of the soothies, why not have a cute one?  To wash the dragon, I've just used a damp cloth with some dish detergent and let him air dry.  It has worn just fine cleaning him with this method.  Just a reminder, the soothie is stitched to the dragon, so you cannot change out the pacifier, unless you feel comfortable sewing and are crafty.  I feel like for the money the dragon costs, I'd be too afraid to botch the job! Overall, I think it's an adorable novelty, but not incredibly useful.  We just appreciate it for being cute and the baby looks sweet with the little dragon laying on his chest, it looks like they're kissing."	2/14/2012

"When our 1st kid was born we were given the Soothie vanilla scented pacifiers by the hospital and our daughter wouldn't take any other pacifier. So, with the twins on the way I decided to get more vanilla scented pacifiers, did some looking around and recognized that gumdrops were rated pretty highly, so I bought two 5 packs. As described in other reviews,  the material (one piece) and construction are flawless.     However, the scent only lasted for about a week.  This is the reason for the one star, don't see giving the product a higher rating if it only maintains its key attribute of scent for that short of a time.    I recommend purchasing the non-scented versions of the gumdrop brand.    (We still have a soothie from 4 years ago that still maintains its scent.) My next pacifier purchase.

"We've always used AVENT brand pacifiers and our daughter has never had a problem with them. We boil them for 2-3 minutes before giving them to her, and put them in the dishwasher regularly.

So, all the pacifiers can be easily attached / removed.  However, with the european style pacifiers (the ones with the ring attached) this holder takes 30 sec. longer to attach.

"as first time parents, we were given the choice to use a pacifier in the hospital. after much debate b/c of breastfeeeding, we decided to let our son have it b/c our son was just very inconsolable while my milk came in. nothing worked to soothe him not shooshing, not swaddling, not anything and not even the hospital nurses could soothe him.  this was a godsend! it did not contribute to any breastfeeding problems and has been the best thing to calm our son.  he is now 3 months old and only wants it when is very stressed so he is not dependent upon it all the time, did not have nipple confusion and had learned to self soothe for the most part now by sucking his fingers.  it is really a great product and i recommend it to anyone wanting to use a pacifier for their baby. our son refuses to use any other brand or type but the soothie for the sucking action is calming to him like when he is feeding."	12/10/2009

"i've only used this on restaurant high chairs so far, but it's been great. my son is big for his age and started sitting up on his own at about 4.5 months, but we still thought he was too small to comfortably sit in a wooden high chair. a friend recommended this cart cover, so we got it and we love it! it's so soft and plush that he is very comfortable, and now he can sit at the restaurant table with us while we eat. (before, my husband and i would each have to take turns holding him and eating since he hated sitting in his car seat or a stroller at a restaurant.)<br /><br />before we bought this one, we checked out other, less expensive covers. we're happy we got this one because it has the following advantages:<br />1. it is very soft and plush (as i said before), so it pads the seat a bit for your little one.<br />2. it straps to the chair, and has its own little strap that holds the child in (it's like a little triangle-shaped piece of fabric that you put his feet through and straps around his waist, so it really keeps him in there! i've seen toddlers crawl out of restaurant high chairs and onto the table, so i think this feature would come in handy for children older than mine, too).<br />3. the tags! our baby loves them. we also use them as loops to attach links ([[asin:b001abzgu2 bright starts lots of links]]) and toys for our son.<br /><br />the main disadvantage to this cart cover is that it's kind of big. that's no big deal when we're taking it out in the car, but we like to walk places too. so, we purchased a 4l stuff sack ([[asin:b000sthhqi sea to summit ultra-sil stuff sack]], size s) for it, which makes it small enough to squeeze into the diaper bag when we're walking out for dinner. i'd recommend getting one if you're a walker too!<br /><br />we love our cart cover! i'm sure it will be great when we use it on an actual cart, too ;)"	8/12/2012

"I was hesitant to buy this at first because we only use the Gumdrop Pacifiers and I didn't see how I could attach those to the bear. It took some effort but I WAS able to do it (see the pictures I uploaded in the product images).<br /><br />The directions I got with the bear state that it can be tossed in the washing machine - pacifier and all - but I have not done that. It's a personal preference, just not sure how safe it is to get laundry detergent on a pacifier, even if it's rinsed. So I wash the pacifier by hand with hot water and replace it when necessary.<br /><br />When I first bought this my baby (then 8 months) did not like this bear because it was a bit heavy and it kept pulling the pacifier out of her mouth. Within a few days, though, she really got used to it. Before buying this, I was going nuts in the dark trying to locate the pacifier in her crib, and the fact that she has designs on her crib sheets didn't help matters because it was easier to lose among them! I purchased this bear to solve my problem, and it solved my baby's problem, too - when she starts crying at night she locates the bear (easy enough to do, even half asleep), puts the pacifier in her mouth and falls back asleep in no time. This bear is a lifesaver!<br /><br />EDIT: Dec/2013 - I recently had to replace this for my almost 2-year-old as she broke the loop. The original one I bought came in a drawstring bag with the green pacifier pictured as well as a clear plastic flat pacifier that looked like a teether. Now I spent more money (originally bought for around $11, this time bought for $15) and the pacifier pictured and the teether pacifier no longer comes with it. They really cheaped out and raised the price. I'm disappointed. Still a great product but not as pictured! I'd give this 4-stars now."	1/19/2012

"i use diapers to clean my house. they do not leave any lint behind and they are great for cleaning windows, mirrors. no streaks are left behind. they leave a great shine on my furniture, glass table tops, and my bathrooms. i was them first before using them when i first purchase them. i only use degtergent and bleach. no fabric softener. i rewash them after each use the same way. if you use fabric softener, they will not absorb. i just use luandry degtergent and bleach and wash them in hot water. they sure save on other cleaning cloths due to you can use these diapers over and over again until they are worn out. it takes years for them to wear out. it is worth the price and i am happy i was able to find more. where i usually purchase the cloth diapters, they do not sell them anymore. they are also great for waxing your vehicle. after you give your vehicle a wash, just take a clean diaper and wipe it down to dry it off and does not leave any scratches or streaks. best to use in the shade. same when waxing your vehicle. your vehicle will shine and sparkle and make it look brand new. no lint left behind or streaks."	8/9/2012

"super lame pun, i know.<br /><br />okay, so i started out using rockin' green hard rock when i first started cloth diapering, due to the extremely hard water in our area.  a very kind person bought it for me off of my registry.  when i ran out, i started using all free & clear, because i had read that people with my type of water were having success with it, and we didn't have a whole lot of money to spend on nice detergents.  i'm not sure if the all free & clear just wasn't cutting it, or if perhaps i wasn't using enough, but i certainly know that i didn't have detergent buildup, but my diapers all of a sudden got super funky, which they had never been before.  i have a feeling the funk came in with some used diapers that i got, but i just couldn't get rid of it!  so i broke down and bought some rockin' green again.  and what do you know?  i am getting rid of the odor problem!  it wasn't completely fool proof, because i've had to adjust the amount and the rinses several times to figure it out, but we are getting there.  yay for not being punched in the face by stench when taking out the diaper pail!!!  thank you, rockin' green!<br /><br />also...  i have a very sensitive baby, and the scent doesn't seem to bother him.  however, i can't even smell it at all by the time i take my diapers out of the dryer, :( so why even bother getting a scented detergent?  just a thought."	1/8/2013

"By the time I had my second child I was soberly aware of the dangers of BPA and many other plastics, so I sought out a natural rubber pacifier.  After a couple of duds, we found this.  It's great! My daughter is 18 months and still uses the small rounded size.<br /><br />First and foremost, it had to be safe.  And this is, in many different ways.  Made from natural rubber and oils, I am not concerned about contaminating plastics.  The shape is awesome; it cleans up easily and has no cracks for bacteria to hide when cleaning and sterilizing.  When it first comes out of the box, it is oily.  As others have mentioned, after you wash for the first time, instructions say to boil for a few minutes.  Let it cool and you'll see the oils have been tamed.<br /><br />My daughter loves this paci.  We once ran out of them after I noticed a crack on the side of the nipple (my fault - I let it go much longer than the recommended 6 weeks between replacement).  That was a very long a night.  I tried a few chemical laden replacements until I could get a new shipment in to no avail.<br /><br />All that being said, these are expensive.  And the cost doubles when you realize that you are supposed to replace them every 6 weeks or so.  Much longer than that and the pacifiers start to harden.  But for all the benefits, I will continue to use these and have some peace of mind knowing I am using the safest product."	1/29/2013

I wasn't going to because of the reviews stating that it smelled rotten or it doesn't smell good.<br /><br />So the first thing I did after receiving this item is to open it and smell it.  It smelled like apple juice.  Open up a canister of apple juice and that's what it smells like... Sweet yet tarty at the same time.  Now I understand why some people might think it smells horrible but I don't have a problem with it. I love apple juice.<br /><br />It wipes the pacifier as its supposed to.  I usually also use it to wipe my Medela breast pump parts after using them.  It's way thinner than the expensive Medela wipes but it wipes the part down good enough.	4/27/2013

"My granddaughter was in the NICU unit for 11 days.The pacifier that is connected to the caterpillar is the kind they used.When she came home, she would not use any pacifier my son and his wife offered her. Then in church, they saw a baby with a wubbanub and how happy the baby was. We searched and found the cutsie caterpillar at a store, but it was the only one. Anyway, when they put this pacifier in her mouth, she was so content and she actually held it to her mouth by the caterpillar.It was such a blessing. with the cutsie caterpillar attached, it stays in the mouth easier and when you need to set it aside, it keeps it from landing on the pacifier.It is a wonderful product.Thank you!!"	9/17/2010

I bought these, as well as some [[ASIN:B003O1IA1S Bornfree Coolflow Pacifiers 2 Pk]], which are BPA and phalate free. Baby did not seem to have a preference as far as nipple shape on the pacifiers, but disliked when the rounded part of the pacifier would smash his nose. I was concerned about it when he slept, because it blocked his nose airways and seemed like it made him uncomfortable. Ultimately, the idea was better than the execution of the product, and we now exclusively use the Born Free pacifiers."	4/16/2012

We have multiples, and once your baby loves them you'll be buying multiples too! We have used these since leaving the hospital, and therefore avoided baby waking up in the middle of the night due to losing her pacifier. They stay in because the stuffed animal helps them stay close to their mouth instead of falling out as soon as they stop sucking. As they get older, the stuffed animal serves as a comfort toy, full of texture and appendages to pull. Sometimes baby sucks and chews on everything but the pacifier! They also are easy to wash. We wash the pacifier in the sink, keeping the plush out of the water for quick cleans. Then, when a deep clean is needed (after all that chewing) we wash the whole thing in a delicate laundry bag in the washing machine with her baby clothes. This is why I recommend more than one, so you can wash one and have a back up for baby. The elephant was great due to the big ears, she loves to pull on those. We constantly have other parents asking about this pacifier....once you have one you'll be a believer."	4/14/2013

When we got the item we throughly inspected it and it is very well made. The plush part is well sewn with the fillings in several smaller self contained parts (i.e. the leg fillings can't pass on other parts of the body). It is light weight but not too light either, if you put it on the baby's belly it will stay there. The baby can lift it with no problems at all.<br /><br />The Soothie pacifier part is sewn into the plush so it won't come apart. It has a large ring with perforations so choke hazard is really none existent.<br /><br />My only complain (and this is why I didn't give it 5 starts and why I won't get another) is the pacifier part has a very small profile. Description says from 0 to 6 months but the tip does look like a new born Cicco pacifier in size and our baby is more used to the #2 orthopedic (flat) profile... so a bigger option for bigger babies would've been nice.<br /><br />It took our baby like 5 seconds to figure out what it was and she instantly and naturally took it from her belly and self inserted it in her mouth. Eventually when she doesn't want it anymore she takes it off and plays with it, speaks with it... it is very cute indeed.<br /><br />If my baby were smaller (say 1 - 3 months) I'd get at least 3 or 4 more. If they make one with a bigger pacifier tip (or another profile) count me in."	9/14/2007

Plus, if the paci wears out, you can just buy a new $2 pacifier rather than a whole new toy!  That just makes more sense to me.

"I originally choose Avent because of the Orthodontic recommendations. I had previously used the AVENT Orthodontic Infant Pacifier for 0-6 months. The (0-6 months) pacifiers had symmetrical nipples as well as mouth guards, so no right side up or upside down. As my baby grew and it seemed as if he was almost able to swallow the whole pacifier I knew it was time to get a larger size. So because he had been using the Avent ones with no difficulty I purchased, what looked like, the same product but in a larger size. But that wasn't exactly the case. The NIPPLE was symmetrical but the mouth guard was not. It wasn't a huge deal really, I didn't return the products. We purchased both the clear and clear with blue center. The blue colored ones were easier to find, especially at night.<br />I will say that we are lucky that our baby decided he didn't want/need to use pacifiers at 8.5 months on his own.<br />These were very useful for us while we needed them. We boiled, hand washed and cleaned in dishwasher and there was not any  discoloration or visible breakdown of product with daily use and wash for 3 months."	2/11/2013

We started my baby on the soothie but he never could keep it in his mouth.  After experimenting with a cheap-o luvs orthodontic pacifier I decided the orthodontic shape would work much better.      First off, the rubber discolored when I sterilized it.  I don't know if that makes a difference, but it came out with a white tinge to it.  He took it right away and the shaped nipple helped keep it in but because the shield hits his nose, it still falls out easily.  The shields that are shaped to the face seem to help him keep it in more easily.  Another flaw is that the loop sticks out from his face, and since my son grabs at everything he can, he keeps pulling it out of his mouth.      Maybe if he wasn't in such a grabby stage or was more able to keep it in his mouth I would have liked it better.

This thing is too cute, the nipple is too large for a new born but should be usable after about 6-9 months. There is no ring or ledge for removal from a baby's mouth or to attach a pacy clip to. This shouldn't be a big deal because this should probably only be used under CLOSE supervision due to the nipple size, weight and materials used. Let's face it, though it can be used by a child it doesn't look like usability was the main goal when making this. Laughter was. It's built well and will work. If your baby doesn't like the nipple on the pacy try pulling the face off of this pacy can gluing it onto another one."	2/15/2012

"i just received the unit, and can't speak to the long term reliabiltiy, but i am most impressed with the quality of the video, audo, range and features. its two way communication allow the parent to remotely turn on different functions in the camera..like music, night light.  the one feature that had me going was a rotary switch on the camera which sets the sensitivity for an alarm in the monitor whenever the sound threshold in the baby's room is exceeded.  it was set for maximum sensitivity and the alarm was reporting continuously.  took me a while to find out what the cause was.  a couple downsides to the system.. if the noise threshold sensitivity level is set high (so you can hear a pin drop in the baby's room, the the alarm will go off when you remotely switch on the music.  also, the camera has a room temperature monitor, but it is mounted so close to the camera, that it reflects more the camera temp than the room's.  so it reads about 10 degrees warmer on the monitor and is virtually useless.

"So far this video monitoring system has performed above my expectations.  After reading some of the other reviews I was worried.  Yes, the movement alarm will sound every other second when you first turn it on.. there's a dial on the camera labelled sensitivity that needs to be adjusted properly (or disabled) before you use the system.  The only thing that surprised me, but in retrospect shouldn't have, was that in order to use Skype you have to have the video monitor attached to a PC.  I didn't read that anywhere before purchasing, but it makes sense.  It's pretty cool that the monitor acts as a wireless video camera for chatting.  It shows up as a normal webcam.  The temperature does read as warmer than it should, but this can be taken into consideration when setting temperature-based alarms.  For me it's not anywhere near the 10 degrees off that others reported."	12/4/2011

Once she knew she could do it, bedtime became a nightmare.  I didn't think she was mature enough to stay in a toddler bed.  And I was having a terrible time sleeping myself worrying that she would get out of her crib and would have free rein in the house.  I was concerned by some of the reviews saying it was poorly constructed, but I was desperate.  I have to say I love it!  My daughter things it's great when I put her in it, she'll even lift the flap for me to zip it sometimes.  She fusses when it's time to lay down.  But that's the same with the tent or without.  She seems to fall asleep more quickly with the tent.  I'm guessing that's partly because she can't throw her comfort items (blanket, lovey and seahorse) out, and partly because she knows she really doesn't have another option.  Instead of trying to get out of the crib, she just lays down.  I will agree the instructions could be better.  It took me longer than I would have liked to put it together. As for those with the zipper troubles, I almost wonder if they had the velcro too tight.  I know the first couple of times I zipped and unzipped it, I was really concerned. (It was like zipping up luggage that was too full.) But when I loosened the velcro holding it to the front rail, the zipper action was much smoother.  I have only had it for 6 weeks.  So I can not speak to it's long term durability.  But so far I am pleased.  The biggest cons I have with this crib tent would be that the zipper is loud.  I usually take out her musical seahorse, and cover her up before I go to bed.  I try to be as quiet as I can, but it sometimes makes her stir.  Thankfully it hasn't woken her up yet.  The other con is using it with a video baby monitor. The mesh makes it hard for the monitor camera to see in the crib.  I had to move the camera several times before finding somewhere that gave me a reasonable view.  For us, the pros of this product far outweigh the cons. Sleep is a precious commodity at our house. It was worth every penny we paid for this crib tent for her to get better sleep, thereby allowing me to get better sleep."	12/4/2011

Well, now that I have them, I cannot imagine life with out them!  Not only do they use my son's favorite brand of pacifier, the Soothie, which most hospitals use, but the lightweight attached toy is of great benefit by helping the pacifier stay in place!  When my son accidentally spits out the pacifier, instead of it bouncing off of him to who-knows-where, it stays in practically the same spot, just below his chin, provided he does not knock the stuffed animal out of the way.  I like this system better than any pacifier clips I've used because with the clips, he'll spit out the pacifier, and although it is still attached to him, it will likely drop to his side and far from his mouth.  With the Wubbanubs, the pacifier stays nearby more often than not, and any parent who has ever used a pacifier knows that that is a great thing!!!  These are definitely worth the money, and be sure to get at least one for the diaper bag and one for home!"	3/14/2009

"I didn't want to give my baby a pacifier AT ALL. I was paranoid that since I was breastfeeding, that any pacifier was going to ruin things... but we were at the hospital for a test and the baby was fussing a bit and the nurse asked if we had a pacifier and I said no. She reached into the cupboard and pulled out one of these, saying they were highly recommended. We took it from her, thanked her, and threw it in the diaper bag. (We didn't try it right then because, as I mentioned, I did NOT want my baby to use a pacifier.)<br /><br />And then came a time when he was really fussy. And we had just watched The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD and learned that Sucking is something that, ironically, PACIFIES a baby and calms them down... so I gave the baby the Soothie...and he loved it! LOVED IT! I immediately went out and bought two more 2-packs (from Target and Babies R Us). I also bought the next-stage pacifiers (one step up from newborn).<br /><br />Of course if he is super agitated (or hungry) then it won't stay in his mouth, but if he is somewhat calm already, then it's enough to keep him calm. I never thought the pacifier was too heavy, as another reviewer thought, claiming that was why it wouldn't stay in the baby's mouth. I also never thought the pacifier holder was too big. I didn't have any pacifier attachers yet, so I just bought the ones made for this pacifier and it worked just fine.<br /><br />As far as the breastfeeding worries, I continued breastfeeding for a few weeks after the introduction of the Soothie with no ill effect."	4/14/2009

Let me count the ways:  1.  One piece construction means they are easy to clean.  We had problems with dirt collecting in the seal or soapy water getting stuck in the nipple of other pacifiers.  With Gumdrop, dirt or germs have no where to collect and hide.    2.  Medical-grade silicon means we can boil the pacifiers to sterilize them or run them through the dishwasher.    3.  Soft nipple that my baby loves.    4.  Firm frame that my baby loves to teeth on constantly, but it's not too hard for her little teeth and gums.    5.  Durability!!!  I wish every product was as durable as these pacifiers!  We've been using them 24/7 for 10 months and they are still in perfect condition.  I check them regularly for wear since she chews so hard on them and we treat them pretty rough, but so far they're perfect!    6.  BPA safe.  Yes, they are.  The center frame is not BPA free, however, it is completely covered by the medical-grade silicone so the baby is never in contact with the center frame.  You shouldn't use it IF the silicone layer becomes compromised, obviously.  (Perhaps if you ran them over with a car, the silicone layer would be compromised.  Otherwise, it holds up amazingly well.)    7.  The cut-out for the nose seems like a little thing, but it's a big thing to my baby.  This is the only one-piece pacifier with the nose cut-out that I could find.    8.  Little hole for a binky strap to loop through, which is critical for us.    Bottom line:  Love love love these pacifiers!"	10/7/2009

"i knew exactly what i wanted when i was going to get baby monitor for my baby daughter. i searched both for a video and audio monitor and decided on the samsung sew-3037. as far as i am concerned, i don't mind spending a little bit more as long as i am getting what i paid for. with this in mind, i quickly decided not to go with an audio monitor. i think the option to monitor my child with both video and audio would worth the extra money i spend. then focusing my attention on the video monitors, i settled between on the samsung sew-3037 for several reasons.<br /><br />before making the purchase i looked at the features  of the monitor. the monitor offered a great range and an interference free connection. it also has some features that really tweeked my interest. i thought the two way talk feature was pretty useful and the fact that you can connect up to four cameras really got me thinking about the various potential uses of this system. (maybe not only as a baby monitor). lastly, it had the vox feature that i didn't know too much about but it got me interested. it said something about noise cancellation and i wondered how that would work. lastly, i was very excited about the ptz feature on the cameras.<br /><br />as for design, i believe samsung's monitor looks sleek and elegant. the black on white really makes the monitor look like a quality product. the overall design of the camera, the color, and shape of the monitor is sharp, and the four way directional button to control the camera is very convenient and easy to use.<br />why i decided to go with samsung: i purchased the sew-3037 because of three reasons.  as a company, i trust samsung. they know how to make electronic products. i love their tv and i love their phones. i figured, they'd do a great job on this as well. secondly, the overall image quality, the ptz feature, and the vox feature. lastly, the monitor being expandable to four camera system.<br /><br />after receiving the monitor: i love it. i tested it for a couple of days and i can't stop playing with it. the overall video and audio quality on the camera is very good. the range hasn't given us any problems and we have a pretty sizeable house. i don't believe it's available now, but i definitely plan to purchase more cameras. the vox is a great feature. it saves battery so you get a good couple of hours on the monitor. it also keeps things quietly and goes into sleepmode when my daughter isn't making any noise for a minute or two. then it comes alive again if she stirs. you can set the sensitivity and also turn it off all together.<br /><br />the feel of the cameras and the monitor is solid, not flimsy at all. the color and design is as i thought, very sleek. i love the look of the camera. i'm thinking i'm going to find other uses for it even after my daughter gets older. i think this was a great buy and definitely will recommend it to my friends."	11/17/2012

I like that the pacifier is all in one piece and that there aren't any hard parts to be uncomfortably places if lost in bed or the car seat. This pacifier does not leave marks on the face, and the cut out makes it so the child's nose isn't covered.    This pacifier is difficult to find in retail stores, but can be ordered in bulk from the supplier. My only complaint about this pacifier is that ordinary pacifier clips do not work with this pacifier."	4/20/2009

I love Wubbanub as my baby can find it in his crib at night much easier, he loves it also as a favorite teddy bear, and because the wubbanub is heavier it is harder to walk around the house with it, decreasing the chances of addiction to having a pacifier all the time in the mouth.

I have the sheep one and it blends into everything. But for some reason the pacifier sits weird with this one, I think it's the beak. It kind of makes it less flexible with the position you have it in. The sheep could be in any position and it'll stay in his mouth. Not with this one. But my 4 month old loves the bright colors of it. He has also started playing with the duck and the sheep now that he's getting older and discovering textures more and more. Like my review of the sheep I would say besides the odd positioning of the pacifier due to the beak, my only other grievance is that the pacifiers aren't removable. You have to wash the whole thing together. And if the pacifier is broken or anything you need to buy a whole new one... kind of aggravating. But I will continue to buy them."	3/4/2013

"this car seat is of excellent quality.  the drawbacks i can see is that the recline function does not recline far enough to compensate for the slope of the seat for the car seat to sit with the marker \\level to the ground\\ like it should in the rear facing position.  this car seat is rather large and i have to move the front passenger seat up in our suv (nissan murano) quite considerably in order to put the car seat in facing rearward.  placing the rolled up towels underneath the base makes the car seat level, but it also requires the front seat be pushed forward even further.  i test fit it in the forward facing position in the back seat and the car seat fits just fine that way.  i wouldn't suggest buying this for an infant if you have a smaller back seat unless you want your front seat passengers spending the first year of baby's life with their knees in the dashboard.  the nissan's back seat is pretty large but perhaps it would fit better in, say, a suburban? <br />i don't like the fact that the owner's manual has diagrams that show the level marks perpendicular to the ground with the car seat reclined while sitting in the back seat without towels.  they could have designed it better in my opinion so i wouldn't have to use the towels. <br />(the level marks are located on the seatbelt harnesses that are visible in the picture of the product if you were wondering)."	4/8/2005

She is almost 5 months old now and she cannot sleep without dragon. My Aunt bought it for her and it is by far her favorite paci! I have tried others when dragon needs washed (by hand) and I had to buy a red and yellow puppy wubbanub because it closely resembles the dragon...<br />The pacifier is very securely stitched onto the dragon and it is relatively easy to clean. Just wash it in the sink with mild dishsoap and a cloth.<br />Ultimately this is a great paci, just wish they weren't so expensive.<br /><br />UPDATE: My daughter is now almost 2 years old and she still loves this binky. It is her absolute favorite! I had to buy a second one just in case the first one needed cleaned. Now, she sleeps with both and will NOT sleep without at least 2: 1 in her mouth and the other in her hand.<br />The stitching has held up wonderfully through the extensive use.

Designed by a medical company, and made of hospital-grade silicone, the GumDrop is lightweight, very soft, and features a unibody construction, so there are no parts that can come loose. The shape of the pacifier allowed him (and all the other preemies in the NICU) to use it in the side-lying position, even with all his tubes (i.e. CPAP, nasal cannula, nasal gavage tube, etc.). You can put your finger in the open end, allowing you to easily control or hold the pacifier; it also allows you to feel how strong your baby's suck is. NNS (non-nutritive sucking) is very important for a baby's development, and our baby got to practice a lot of NNS with his GumDrop. It helped him to self-soothe himself as well when we couldn't be at his cribside.     Following his discharge, I have purchased two full-term mango colored pacifiers for his use. The company has since introduced full-term pink and blue colored pacifiers, but I would purchase the mango colour again. Overall, I highly recommend this product. The price is great, although the S/H charges are high."	10/30/2007

"we love, love this car seat!  we bought this one when we realized how great our first roundabout 55 was.  so, we have two now... one for each car.  we didn't want to hassle with switching the car seat over each time we took a different car.  and since our decision was to install using the lap-shoulder belt instead of the latch system, installation takes a few more minutes than we have on a daily basis.  we switched our baby over to this car seat at about 6 mo old, but i can see how this seat would also accommodate a much smaller baby too.  we plan for him to use this until he outgrows it and moves into a booster.  my only concern is whether or not he will outgrow this before he can safely sit in a booster.  the seat seems to fit him perfectly now, so i wonder how much growing he can do before he's too big.  and, we're almost already using the entire strap length (not much more slack to pull out).  however, we had these concerns prior to deciding on purchasing this car seat (and then purchasing a second), and we are still entirely happy with this purchase.  i still would not buy anything else while having these concerns.  the quality is wonderful.  i have experience with other brands that our son's grandparents have in their vehicles, and i can say that i'd never buy any of them instead.  you can't even compare the quality and comfort.  the other britax models are great too, but we couldn't spend $300+ on a car seat when we needed to buy two.  plus, a friend of mine has the model with the built in head supports, and because her son was so tall, he was forced to use a different car seat because his shoulders were uncomfortable.  we figured we were safest if we just went with the basic model, which has proven so far to be a good decision.  highly recommend, as we will be repeat purchasers of this car seat."	5/4/2011

Amazing how things change!<br /><br />My son is about a month old and has reflux, which is apparently really common in newborns. Suckling helps the reflux - which means he was nursing constantly - CONSTANTLY. Sometimes 3 to 4 hours in one session. Now that he is back up to birth weight, he was given the clearance for pacifers and bottles. This is the only pacifer that he took to - and it has saved my sanity. Probably his, too. Now that he's not getting a constant supply of milk, his number of spit ups has decreased. But he is still suckling, which helps the reflux. And he's not suckling on me, which gives my body a chance to recuperate. He flat out rejected other pacifers, except this one. I also like that it has the finger hole - I can hold his head with one hand and still have a finger in/on the binky to help hold it in place, and still have another hand free.<br /><br />Buy one pack. If your baby likes it, too, then load up!"	10/3/2012

"LOVE THESE!<br /><br />A lot of people say they're baby won't take them if they introduce them later, which I can understand because the nipple is a lot different than a traditional pacifier.  I did my research on them before my baby was born and decided on the gumdrop, because they don't block the baby's face and the nipple is more contoured to a smaller baby's mouth.  I took them to the hospital with me and my daughter's been loving them since the day she was born!  I do think they are pretty ugly (I like the other types with t he cute designs), but I believe these are safer and healthier.  My only concern is that she doesn't like other pacifiers and I believe these only go up to 6 months, I haven't seen a larger size anywhere.  Guess that's when we will try to take her off the bink?<br />All in all, very pleased with these.<br /><br />PS- Don't use in the microwave sterilizer, it changes the pink and purple to an ugly brown color, not sure why.

"my husband and i got this mobile to match the hampton bedding set and i have not experienced any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers.  <br /> <br />one thing to make note of however is that the assembly directions that come with the mobile are not for the exact model that this one is, so the instructions are not 100% accurate. there is actually less assembly required for this one since the hanging pieces are already attached to the fabric canopy, so all you do is fit the plastic hanger pieces together... (which you will want to do with caution as the picture illustration is backward to how it really has to go together and if you dont pay close attention you could try to force it in wrong and break it). if your crib has wide top railings or round top railings then this mobile will not work for you as the arm has a lip that helps secure it that will not work on wide sections of railing. <br /> <br />i still rate this a 5 because for us we had no problems at all and it really is a beautiful mobile."	4/8/2005

It's a little expensive, but I would buy another one for the ease of finding it when she drops it.  If your child likes the soothie pacifiers, I would recommend this."	3/2/2011

The caterpillar was the first wubbie she had.  We got great use out of it.  My daughter was able to maneuver the pacifier and put in her mouth once falling out at a month or at least a little after one month old.  It's easy to spot if it happens to fall so losing it was pretty slim.  Once we started seeing the fabric starting to wear thin (this was after a year or so use) we replaced it...well that and because my husband and I are über nostalgic we decided to replace the caterpillar with a new one so that we could keep her first and put it in her memory chest.<br /><br />We receive many compliments and questions as to where to purchase them.  I like to use them as part of a congrats on finding out your expecting/baby shower/new baby gifts because they aren't so mainstream so I find its a gift that stands out...parents love them...babies love them...	12/19/2012

The only thing I do not care for is the fact that it sometimes seems to come up over her nose when she is sleeping, which bothered me at first but it doesn't seem to restrict her breathing at all. I was told by a friend to try the gumdrop ones because there is a cutout area for their noses, but she spit those right out as well.

The weight of the kitty cat helps keep the pacifier from falling out, which allows me some interruption-free sleep at night.    Now that she is a little older (almost 4 months), she likes to play with it, and strokes her hands over it while she is sucking the pacifier.  When it does fall out of her mouth, she tries to put it back in, although at this point she usually ends up sucking on a leg or tail instead.  :)  This little guy might seem a tad expensive for what it is, but I would buy another one in a heartbeat if this one got lost.    The kitty cat is very well sewn.  My baby tugs and pulls at the legs, and the stitching is holding up perfectly.

First of all, I used it immediately on myself after coming home from the hospital.  I used it to sit on to take the pressure off of my stitched area.  I could sit on the couch, in the bed and at the kitchen table without needing any medication..THANKS BOPPY!!  As for my son, I use it for him to sleep on while I'm doing housework.  I prop it on the couch and lay him in the middle on his side, which adjusts to the perfect size for him.  He sleeps like a BABY!  Next, I use it when I feed him.  I breastfed and went to bottles later.  It was/is perfect for both.    I use it to lay him it after he eats so I can talk to him and he can explore the world.    I use it sometimes when he is doing tummy time.    I use it for my nieces so they can hold him without having to wear their arms down since they are only 5 and 7.  I have several more, but those are the main points.  I would buy it over and over again if anything ever happened to my Boppy.    Also, I wash the slip cover many times, and it is standing strong.  I have only had to wash the pillow a few times, but it still looks brand new.  BOPPY GETS MY CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT VOTE...A+++++++++++++  ***UPDATE...It also helped with my son sitting up.  I would place it around him so he wouldn't get hurt if he would fall over.  It keeps going and going and going..."	4/7/2005

When she was born they gave a soothie pacifier at the hospital. She won't take any other pacifier and they are easy to lose and impossible to find in the dark.  This product is great because you can find it in the dark, it help to keep it in easier by having the monkey laying on her chest, and when she is not sucking on the pacifier she is holding the monkey.

Our baby is exclusively breastfed (and only took to a pacifier for about 1-2 mths, and then said, no, thank you, in the form of WAAHHs!) so the pacifier isn't mommy, but this Wubbanub seems to help calm her down when I am not able to get to her (i.e. while she is in the carseat). She has even put herself to sleep with it in the car seat and the stroller. The lamb can rest comfortably on her chest while she finds the nipple herself, instead of me putting/holding a pacifier to her mouth (which would also annoy me if I were her). As others have stated, it would be great to be able to detach the pacifier from the Wubbanub, but oh well, it is still a must buy item. You will fall in love with this lamb.

As a plastics engineer, even though many pacifiers are bpa-free I prefer the natural rubber for my child.<br /><br />My child started using a Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier at 3 weeks but was not a big pacifier fan until trying Avent Soothie at 4 weeks. Luckily we had received several as shower gifts. However the course of the next 8 weeks we managed to lose 3!  I also had read about replacing pacis at 6-8 weeks. I would agree with this when they're teething or if they reuse the same one frequently. But if you have enough to rotate than its bit necessary.<br /><br />I ordered these due to low Soothie supply & the age cap of 3 months. I like that these can go to 6 months instead.  My daughter has only tried for 1 day & although not as crazy about this one as the Soothie (they have to work harder because of the thickness & opening inside the paci) she likes it!  If I had started with this over Soothie I think she would have gone right for it.<br /><br />Overall a great product & only gets 4 instead of 5 stars b/c of my daughter's preference for Soothies!"	10/25/2012

They last a long time and don't get all gross like some other brands from daily use. If you get water inside them, they will squeak when baby sucks it and get gross. So I always dip the nipple in water then wipe it clean. Also you will need to clean around the base of the nipple part where it attaches to the hard plastic. There can be buildup of milk, formula, food, etc. you will want to clean out. Again, just dip the nipple part under hot water then use your fingernail or a towel to wipe the buildup away from the base. DO NOT SUBMERGE - or it will squeak when baby uses it (which kept mine awake bc of the noise it made) and grow all kind of nasty mold inside the nipple. Just dip it into hot water. I would check about using the microwave bag for sterilizing - not sure if these are rated for that."	8/31/2011

Once you have *color* video (only when not using night vision), you will never contemplate getting a black and white one.    At 75 feet and three walls away, our kids' images and voices are perfectly clear when monitored from our bedroom.    Despite what one reviewer mentioned, we have had absolutely NO interference with our 802.11g wireless setup at home.  802.11g operates at 2.4 GHz, and this monitor is at 900 MHz.  There should not be interference.

It goes with us everywhere and is easy to access quickly when my daughter needs her pacifier. I like the snap-on strap to attach it to her diaper bag and it's just large enough to carry two pacifiers if I need to bring a back-up paci. We had a JJ Cole pacifier pod for almost a year before it got lost while running some errands. I replaced it with this one and am so pleased. I like that this Skip Hop one has a zipper closure instead of velcro and it a tad wider inside so it fits pacifiers easier without bending them. I'm not sure what, if ever, I'll use the outer little pocket for, but I would recommend this pacifier pod over the JJ Cole ones."	2/15/2011

He was so angry at the doctors, that this calmed him right down.  By the end of his visit he was asleep.  When I researched the soothie, I came across these and so far he loves them.

"My husband and I bought this for our 2 month old who has been having problems going to sleep at night and seems to hate the dark. After sleeping with a light or tv on we wanted to get some type of night light. I was weary of this since it doesn't play music and it looked kind of generic to me. However this is the best thing we've bought our son yet. The first time turning it on, his eyes lit up and he got really excited. We use it every night now and turn it back on during our middle of the night feedings. He immediately looks up in awe and starts to get sleepy again. I've put this on a shelf, on the floor, and even in his bassinet when he wasn't in it and it's always worked perfectly. For the amber glow to work you need a very dark room, but hey that's what the middle of the night is. The amber glow also seems to be the most calming and puts him to sleep quickly. Worth every penny! Highly recommend for infants who are fussy about going to sleep at night."	12/4/2011

There is a semi-hard piece of plastic in the inside of this pacifier, and I guess the sucking motion itself caused the hard plastic to cut its way through the soft plastic. Now the soft plastic has worn off of the sides of the pacifier and it looks really torn up.

I had planned on buying the Medula because that is what anyone I know used.  When I got to Babies-R-Us the sales lady talked me into the Playtex.  She said they had just had a demonstration at the store about the pump and if she was to buy a pump over again she would go with this one.  She said she has a Medula, but after the demonstration she really liked this one.  So, on her advice and the basis that this would be cheaper for me because I had coupons I went for it! <br /> <br />I find the pump to be very comfortable and I use full speed and suction.  I do not get sore like I used to when I used my manual Medula from the hospital.   The storage is great and it is very easy to clean! <br /> <br />After about a month of use I did have a problem where the pump would randomly shut off and eventually stopped working.  I called Playtex and they overnighted me a new pump nad sent me a tag to return the old one free of charge.    I went less than 24 hours without it.

"These little wubbanub's looked like the perfect answer for my three month old - who was constantly losing his binky ALL DAY LONG. I thought it would help him learn to put it back in as well as be weighty enough to lay on his chest in just the right spot - so if he fell asleep he could pop it back in himself. And - believe it or not - it did all those things. HOWEVER - my son totally hated the pacifier. We had been using every brand of binkies, so I figured what's another new brand? Right? WRONG! We had used nuks, playtex, avent, etc. All with no problem but the soothie pacifier attached to this wubbanub is HUGE. I am not kidding. Not just huge on the outside plastered on your little one's face...but huge like a giant long nipple too! Coupled with the fact it was ugly as sin it made for hilarity at starbucks one day when all the other mommies watched in horror as I proudly pulled out my new fancy wubba to give to my little one and he proceeded to choke like a bulimic after thanksgiving. AND, the poor little dude kept giving it the old college try because he wanted the sucker and I let him because I forgot back up. I just kept praying he'd make it work. It was all very sad. Long story much shorter I sent my hubby to babies r' us to pick up as many small stuffed animals as he could find. That weekend I bought velcro and we created our own wubanubs. Here are 3 major benifits to making your own:<br />1) you can detach the pacifier and wash it for REAL. As well as wash the buddy it is attached too! Unlike the wubba. IMPORTANT - The wubbanub DOES NOT come apart ( very gross and stupid)<br />2) you can use whatever brand of pacifier your little one enjoys, a major plus if you actually want this whole learn your paci is attached to a frog thing to work.<br />and<br />3) Compared to the ugly things my little macgyvered knock offs look amazing. AND THAT should tell you something about how hideous these actually are. (Seriously, I am far from ambitious. I don't scrapbook, paint, or even cook anything that requires anything more then buttons on the microwave - so if you do - yours will probably be even more fantastically superior to these little nightmares)<br /><br />I have to say one nice thing though.

"this monitor is definitly the best purchase we made! being a first time parents we were constantly worried about everything! especially when our baby was asleep. yeah, we tried sleeping in the same room for a while, but around 3 months she started waking up every time we moved. so we purchased the monitor and set it up right on the side of the crib, so that we could see her face. you can hear every breath she takes and the video quality is great: when the lights are off, you can see as good as if it was daytime. we live in an appartment building, but there is hardly ever any interference. the baby is now 1 and half and we moved the camera in the corner of the room, so that you could see the whole crib. i can see her playing and it is so much fun watching her talk to her toys and laugh all by herself. i would recommend this product for every parent out there."	4/1/2006

Addictive though!	"We've been using these pacifiers since our daughter was about 6 weeks old.  We never switched to the super soothie (which is the 2 pack of pink ones you see in the drugstores) because my daughter never took to them.<br /><br />The pink/purple set is a fun change- I originally got them to try broaden my daughter's horizons a bit after my friend mentioned that her daughter was so obsessed with her green soothie that even at 2+ years old she is enamoured with anything that turquoise color!<br /><br />The downside is that now my daughter LOVES the purple one and insists on it by name (papo one!), so to have another onhand, I need to buy a whole new package!  You might be thinking that if one's child is old enough to demand the soothie by name and color she is probably too old to be using this thing?  I say I would think the same thing.  Don't do what I did- break your little one's addition in the 9-12 month timeframe, becuase if you leave it until 20 months (where we are now) it's probably become your child's 'lovey' by now and they are well addicted.  We'll tackle this issue soon, but til then, I need another purple soothie."	2/7/2011

My son took it and it certainly helped in those early days where he wanted to suck 24-7.  He never could keep it in his mouth though which I chalked up to being so little and perhaps not convinced that he loved the pacifier.  I wasn't convinced I wanted him to love it so that was OK.     Then at 1 month he would scream whenever we gave it to him so we quit.  At 3 months though he started sucking on everything and we broke out the pacifier again.  He could hold it in his mouth for a little while but without careful attention it gets pushed out.  Now at 3.5 months we need a pacifier so that my husband might have a chance of putting the baby to bed when I'm not here to nurse him down.  The soothie falls out so fast that there is no chance it could work to do anything but comfort him when he is really upset.      With some experimentation we have discovered that he needs   a) the shield that is molded to the face.  The soothie shield (and the natursutten [[ASIN:B001AVNK6E Natursutten All-Natural Rubber Orthodontic Pacifier, 0-6 months]] that we tried) bumps up against his nose and gravity makes it more likely to fall out.    b) a more shaped nipple.  The orthodontic ones work but so does the MAM [[ASIN:B00211NRF6 Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone Pacifier - Size 1 - 0-6 months - boy colors]] nipple (which is shaped like a bulb but theoretically compresses to an orthodontic shape, though it doesn't really when I tried it. )  The bulb shape of the MAM seems to be enough to keep it behind his gums which seems to help it stay in too.    We just tried out the MAM and he kept it in his mouth for 30 minutes before pushing it out with his tongue (while playing)!  It also has no top/bottom like the soothie so it is easier to get in his mouth in the dark.    Pacifiers are cheap (except for the Natursutten) so it isn't a big deal to try a few different ones--just because one baby does well with one doesn't mean another one will or won't.  But for us, the MAM worked much better.  I'm wondering if we should have tried it earlier--perhaps it would have been helpful in those fussy early months where he wouldn't take the soothie."	8/10/2009

Even when he is cranky, he will not suck on soothie for long. Probably the shape of it doesn't appeal to him. I cannot talk about how habit forming it is, as my son is just 4.5 months old.<br /><br />NUK Pros:<br /><br />My son loves it, he is able to hold it in his mouth for long periods<br />Orthodontic, so I worry less about my sons teeth allignment<br /><br />NUK cons:<br /><br />Water enters the nub when I wash the paci. I squeeze and shake to get it out.<br />Sometimes when he sucks it for too long, the shape of the exterior of the paci leaves an impression around his lips.<br />In amazon, pink color and green color are paired, boy colors are not exclusive."	6/26/2012

(i did have to use a towel underneath to make the base level which was also the case with the air protect). the straps have yet to twist and my daughter's head rests in a comfortable position. the seat is very cushy yet supportive and the adjustable straps are definitely a plus.    this car seat is simply a cut above the rest. it has all of the best safety features with little extras (belly pad, recline lever, easy-remove seat cover, etc) that make it an easy seat to use and own. yes, it is heavy (21 pounds), but it weighs less than my daughter so that is not an issue for me. and yes, it is expensive but in my opinion a car seat is not an area to look for a bargain. i am very happy with this seat andam relieved that the stress of trying to find the perfect car seat for our daughter is over."	9/26/2010

Friends recommended a pacifier, but she was so little (6 pounds at birth), she couldn't keep a pacifier in her mouth, and if she lost it, that only made her 1000 times fussier. And then we found the wubbanub. Even when she was very young, she could hold onto this pacifier. She loves the pattern, and she enjoys chewing on all parts of it. It's also easy to find, and hard to lose - a winning combo. There's something extra special about the giraffe. We have a little duck wubbanub too, but the horns on the giraffe and the weight of the feet just make it perfect somehow....Whoever invented these is genius. Also, if you are concerned, the wubbanub is light enough that a baby can easily move it, so you don't have to worry about a suffocating/choking hazard."	5/17/2013

"i never thought i'd like a velcro cloth diaper so much. it actually works really well. my baby couldn't really fit into it until she was just over 10 lbs, but once she did, it's our easiest diaper to use. the velcro is soft and has held up well in the wash. i've heard horror stories about velcro in other brands of cloth diapers, but this brand seems to have gotten it right. this diaper is probably the best for when you have someone else watching your baby (like a grandparent or something), because the velcro makes it easy for people who aren't used to using cloth diapers. i also love all the cute designs these come in and really like how this is an aio diaper with a pocket, so you can always stick another insert in there for extra-extra absorbancy(overnight maybe, or for heavy wetters), but otherwise, it's just fine on its own."	11/12/2011

This wubbanub has the paci just like the hospitals.  It's just heavy enough to stay in place so you aren't constantly having to put the paci back in your infant's mouth.  Then, when your baby is old enough they can hold on to the wubbanub's ears or paws and put it in their mouth all by themselves.  Great for them to carry around when they are older and most importantly the paci is big enough that when dropped it never rolls away - we never lost one!  We bought three.  toss in washer.

"Our 2-week old daughter started crying and screaming from gas pain and would settle when we would let her suck on our finger.  She is exclusively breastfed and we were worried about nipple confusion if we used a pacifier.  Using our finger was often inconvenient so we eventually decided to give the pacifier a try.  It did calm her right away and I liked that the design was shaped slightly like a breast nipple.    The pacifier did change her latch slightly so we try to use it as little as possible.  The biggest down side for us was that she can't keep it in her mouth.  It falls out or she spits it out every few minutes and starts crying until we put it back in.  For her the MAM style of pacifier worked better...it didn't rub on her chin and she was able to keep it in her mouth.  I think the Avent Soothie works ok, and may work well for another child.  It just wasn't the best fit for ours."	5/16/2011

We are still using it three years on with our second child. Folding is about as simple as it gets and it pretty much lives in the back of our Prius with decent room left over for bags and groceries. Nothing has broken on it. There are a LOT of more expensive strollers and combi systems, but I'm not really sure what they could do any better. This one hits the real sweet spot. Most other similar strollers with an infant seat system are either quite a bit heavier, or much more expensive - or both. There are lighter strollers - but do they work with an infant carrier type car seat?  What we really wanted was a combi system (stroller/car seat) that was light enough for my wife to lift and put in the trunk. Most of the combi strollers we looked at were more like 25-30 pounds. This is only 17 lbs. Believe me, it makes a difference when you lug these things around 4-5 times a day for a few years.   This works perfectly with the matching SnugRide infant seat. That comes with a detachable base, you can easily get extra bases for different cars. And everything is priced very reasonably.   I don't know if this is still the best on the market at this point, but it's been great for us. I guess my advice would be - look at the stroller weight before you buy anything, and try to get something less than 20 lbs."	12/4/2011

When she is crying in the dark instead of feeling all around the crib searching for them it sure is handy to have the soft glow to help out.

About a year ago it started acting wiggy... it wouldn't turn off with the button (have to unplug the power source from the back to turn it off) and sometimes the other buttons don't work either. I love that it has a built-in nightlight, but that has also been acting strangely - it doesn't always turn off (again, I have to unplug the power cord from the back to shut it off).<br /><br />As far as music selection goes, it's good but not great. It doesn't have that many songs on each set so it loops over and over (which, I would personally find annoying so I don't put my son through it). And there's no way (that I found) to go back or forward with the songs. My son likes one particular song and doesn't understand when I tell him we have to wait for it ... or that we can't hear it again right away.<br /><br />The nature sounds are not that great - I was hoping for a nice, calming ocean sound but there doesn't seem to be one on here. The only one that I heard was the one with the whales (which sounds too scary for a baby's room, especially when they are alone in the dark). I usually just leave it on the white noise sound.<br /><br />The sound/speakers are just okay - kind of has that hollow sound to it - so I really haven't bothered using the iPod with it.<br /><br />I think the idea is good, but the quality is not. Was tetering on whether to give it one stars or two and decided one based on quality and sound. Do yourself a favor and get a regular sound machine, Homedics makes a decent one that you can dock/play an iPod with."	12/4/2011

My recommendation is to use this early on but try to get your child to use a different pacifier during the day before they get too used to it. Our daughter only uses a pacifier for naps and at night but if she needs one during the day we're trying to get her to use a standard pacifier.

I've only ordered some from Amazon once, and luckily I got blue ones for my son. I've also bought some from Target, who carries all different sizes. I gave some to another friend with a newborn and now her baby girl is hooked too! Such a great product with such cute designs."	11/10/2012

"Not only are these incredibly cute, but it is fantastic for those times when binky pops out of the mouth in the middle of the night and baby wakes up and needs to find it. I spent months getting up in the middle of the night, multiple times, to retrieve a binky that either rolled out of the crib or baby couldn't find it. This one is easy to find in the crib and it won't fall out of the crib!! This is essential to parents' sanity and sleep!! We get tons of comments on this because it's so cute and unusual. I've even washed this in the washing machine (air dry) and it didn't fall apart. After probably a year of solid use, the binky part did eventually come off of the elephant, but I re-attached it with a safety pin and it's still being used. The biggest downfall of this binky is that other kids really want to steal it! :-) I would absolutely recommend this product for you and for every baby shower you ever attend!

"We got our Soothie 2-pack today, while my son was napping.  I gave him one as he was getting ready to head down for his next nap.  It took a little work to get him to hang onto it, as he's been used to more traditionally shaped pacifiers (he's 11 weeks old), but he caught on fairly fast, and the next time he went to nurse I noticed that he was taking a deeper latch already!  I had some supply problems early on, so anything that encourages good latching and better milk transfer is okay by me.    I've noticed some reviews criticizing this pacifier for being a potential choking hazard.  Let me say that there is a degree of personal responsibility here.  These are not the hard plastic pacifiers most people are used to... they are medical grade silicone, made for newborns.  The whole thing is softer, more flexible, and yes, that means that you have to watch your baby to make sure he can't fit the whole thing into his mouth, because babies try that.  On the wrapper it says not to leave your baby alone with a pacifier (any pacifier), and I imagine that it's for precisely this reason.  If your child can fit the whole Soothie into his/her mouth, it's too small and you need to buy a binky that is appropriately sized for your child.    As for the suckerfish look... I think it's hilariously cute.    Update 2/19/12 - Still loving the Soothie, still refusing any and all other binkies.  Longer review on my blog:    [...]"	2/6/2012

"I fought the idea of a pacifier for my second son, but he was colicky and we resorted to any method possible to stop the screaming. He became attached to the Soothie brand pacifier we were given at the hospital. When he was around 2 months, we began the battle of him losing his pacifier in the night and I was constantly waking up to put it back in his mouth. I had been skeptical about trying a Wubbanub because I was afraid he would form an attachment to it since it's a toy and a Soothie in one and that it would be hard to break him of it. In a state of sleep deprivation, I picked this one up and am so glad I did!<br /><br />When he was still small, I swaddled this up with him and night so that he didn't lose it. Did it make him sleep through the night? No. But at least I wasn't constantly retrieving a pacifier. As he got older, he learned to hold it himself and guide it back in his mouth. The longhorn attached made it easier for his immature eye-hand coordination than if it was just the pacifier. Now that he's 8 months old, he chews on the horns, sucks on the tag, and chews on the pacifier. I don't have bumper pads in his crib, so other pacifiers fall through the rail. This Wubbanub stays in the crib much better than those do.<br /><br />I've read reviews that say it's cheaply made or not easily washable and I do not agree. About once a week I round up all the pacifiers and boil them. I just hold the nipple of this into the boiling water to keep the longhorn dry. Rather than throwing it in the washing machine with clothes when the longhorn gets dirty (and it does a lot because it goes everywhere with us), I just hand wash it with some Dreft and let it air dry. This keep it from getting fuzzy, as other reviewers have mentioned.<br /><br />I had actually gotten on here to order a second one because we like it so much and I'm afraid we'll lose the one we have. My fear came true that this has become his lovey, but I plan to just cut the pacifier off when the time comesto wean off of it. I still wish he didn't use a pacifier, but I'm so happy that we found something he likes and is capable of using all on his own!<br /><br />UPDATED JULY 2013<br /><br />I still fully stand behind this product, but wanted to update that we did have our first big issue with this Wubbanub. At 10 months, my son is a terror when it comes to teething. He bites and chews very hard on anything available, including this pacifier. On the one he's been using for 6 months, he was finally able to rip the pacifier part off of the longhorn by chomping down on the pacifier and pulling on the plush part over and over for weeks. It came off in one piece and wasn't a choking hazard, but it's thoroughly confused my son! I think part of the problem is that these are made with Soothies for ages 0-6 months, which has thinner material in the pacifier. If I had a way to attach a 6+ month paci to this, it would probably fare much better. Still a great product, but keep an eye out for your little chompers and make sure that the material is still holding firm."	5/14/2013

"My baby is 3 mos old and we introduced a pacifier around 4 weeks.  It took exactly 2 nights of trying to find spit out pacifiers on the floor before we ordered a Wubba Nub.  He loves that he can hold onto the soft stuffed animal, and I love that it's much harder for him to launch this across the room.  As he's gotten bigger, he can now navigate the pacifier into his mouth by holding on to the Dino and it helps him put himself back to sleep.  I wash it frequently since he takes it to daycare, and it has held up very well in the washing machine.  This is my new go to product for all my new mom friends!"	2/21/2013

"My daughter got the Soothie binky in the hospital and would only take that kind thereafter. The Soothie blocks their nose and it doesn't seem to stay in their mouth very well because it isn't contoured to their face. I found this Gumdrop one on Amazon and she switched over right away, no problems. I think it stays in better and makes breathing easier (or maybe it just makes me breathe easier not seeing her little nose blocked). It also has a hole for a binky holder, which is great. Another good point is that it is all one piece for safety, and I don't know how my daughter always falls asleep with the binky wedged between her face and the bed, but with the Gumdrop it's not uncomfortable because it doesn't have the hard plastic piece. The vanilla scent is nice but it does fade after washing a few times. It's not that big of a deal for me because I didn't buy it for the scent. :)"	1/7/2011

"It is so simple, but helpful in so many ways: 1) helps hold the pacifier in baby's mouth while they are sleeping - this is number one benefit in my opinion  2) it makes it easier for baby to grab and put the pacifier in by herself  3) If I'm holding my baby and she's got this in her mouth I can easily hold on to the lamb's back leg, so if baby stops sucking, lamb does not drop to the floor  4) in the event lamb does drop to floor, pacifier doesn't go bouncing all over the room like regular pacifier does  5) doubles as a lovie/attachment toy  The price seems like a lot for a pacifier, but IT IS WORTH IT -- definitely  My one complaint, as others here have mentioned, I wish the pacifier could be detached from the toy."	2/7/2011

I think these ones are less expensive that the traditional pacifier you can get at Target, and those ones dont smell like vanilla.

One of the best parts about this pacifier is that I do not have to attach it to a string pacifier holder (which could get wrapped around my little one), I would simply just rest it on him and he would push at it if he wanted it.  This sweet little animal is light weight yet heavy enough to stay put in a carseat or while he sleeps in his bassinet.  This product is great, I have had it for my child since he was born, I gave it to him about 4-5 days in as a newborn (which I have come to realize is the best time to give a pacifier to a newborn, it is not too early for nipple confusion and not too late that they refuse it).  He has been able to grasp at it from day one.  He was able to push the little animal back in if it started to fall out or push it out if he did not want it.  The design makes it easier to stay in their mouths when they are so little and are learning to suck.     It is also easy to wash and it drys quickly.  I recommend two so that you can always have one ready to go.    I did see a few other wubbanub pacifiers on sale at Babies'R'us, but when my friend purchased hers I noticed that the quality was not as good, they were much more flimsy and very light weight, making it hard to stay put.   When I was still pregnant I wrote...I love this product, it is so precious and this is the best price I have seen for these.  My friends baby has them and loves them so much, she is able to grab it at put it back in her mouth herself.  I am still pregnant and hoping that my baby will love them as much as my friends baby did.  I love how soft they are and they are a good size, not too large and not too small.

I had gotten her a clip for her binkie, but I wanted something better than that. I asked my friend in my breastfeeding support group where she got hers and she told me the website on the binkie. I came to amazon.com upon learning the name of them and I found a TON more than the duck and red puppy. I let my oldest daughter pick out my youngest daughters Wubbanub and she found this. I love how soft the elephant is. I was also very happy that for the first time in her two months of being on Earth she decided she didn't need the vanilla scent of her soothies from the hospital. We will now be ordering her the Red Dragon, as that was the one my husband wanted to get her.  I only gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because of the way it has to be cleaned, and the binkies are not interchangeable if the soothie gets worn down. At about 13-20 dollars a pop, I would think they would find a safe way to make the binkies interchangeable."	1/22/2012

She's been using them since she was a few months old & they were perfect for those late nights when her binky would fall out & she was able to push it back into her mouth & go right back to sleep.  I had used the plain soothies with nothing attached when she was first born & I spent countless nights being woken up because she lost her binky & couldn't get it back.  These are great.  About once a week I toss them in my lingerie wash bag & wash them & they come out practically dry.  About an hour on a drying rack & they're good to go.  Do not put other items in the bag though because any fuzz or lint will cling to the pacifier part & you'll have to rinse it off.  I usually rinst them off in hot water anyway right after they've gone through the wash.	12/2/2012

"i have had this pillow for months now, so i feel i can give an informed review.  it took about a week to get used to sleeping with it and to break in the part where my head goes, but since then i have been more than happy with it -- in fact, i had my baby over a month ago and i still use it and find it incredibly comfortable.  the best part while i was pregnant was that i slept more soundly with the pillow so i didn't wake up to go to the bathroom as many times during the night, so i actually felt well-rested in the morning.  the best part now that the baby is born is that i can fold it in half in the middle of the night when the baby wakes up and it becomes a backrest for nursing - very comfortable and much better than just leaning against a regular pillow because it has \\arms\\ for more support.  one thing though:  the jersey knit cover is very comfortable and fits the pillow perfectly, but the regular cotton cover is not soft at all and it doesn't fit properly around that curved area at the top so it ends up digging into your neck/shoulder area.  stick with the jersey cover."	3/13/2012

"i did a lot of research and this stroller was exactly what i was looking for.  it's extremely light and rides super smooth.  the turning radius is great as well.  i love being able to access the basket from the front and back.  i also love the child's tray can be opened on either the left or right side.  my daughter loves being in it.  another positive is the way it closes.  it actually closes yet remains standing so it's very easy to pick up and put it in my car.  my other maclaren umbrella stroller wold crash to the ground when i tried closing it.    my only negative would be that i can't seem to get my daughter to sit up as much as i like.  since the adjustment for the relining seat is a strap, it won't allow me to pull it tight enough to have her sit up straight.  that makes it difficult for her to get her drink or snacks in the tray.  i also have a bob duallie which i love but it's very bulky and heavy.  this stroller is perfect for quick trips to the store.  i also purchased the [[asin:b005pk1g76 diono buggy buddy stroller organizer, black]] and it works perfectly.  great for holding extra drinks, cell phone, keys, etc.  don't hesitate to buy this stroller!  highly recommend!  and as always the shopping experience with amazon was amazing!"	1/11/2012

So we did put a little tape over the speaker in the back just because we have it RIGHT on our bedside table in my ear. :)    the video is GREAT clarity in light (color) or dark (black and white) rooms! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Also, there is a A and B channel so if you have two you want to keep track of you can switch to the other channel (after purchasing another camera of course).

This pacifier is amazing.  When my son was a small infant his pacifier would constantly fall out meaning he would wake up and want it back, but being a infant he could not find it.  However with this product, if the pacifier fell out of his mouth it would still be lying on him and he would be able to find it again to sooth him back to sleep.  Not only that, but when he was so young he could start holding it and directing it back into his mouth or pick it up.

"My son loves his Wubbanubs - he has five different ones, the monkey being the first one we got for him. He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.    When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part. That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up. Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has. We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his wubbas (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.    The wubbanubs are very easy to clean and they have been very durable. I highly recommend Wubbanubs!"	8/18/2010

"We have several of Avent's 'regular' pacifiers at home, which my daughter likes and uses on a regular basis.  When I purchased these, the glow-in-the-dark feature was not important to me, as I really didn't expect the glow to last for long (c'mon folks, it's glow-in-the-dark - the technology hasn't improved much since 1985...haha).  As other reviewers have noted, the glow really does not last too long after the lights go out.<br /><br />I'm sure most parents who use pacifiers for their babies would agree with me on this - we have pacifiers floating all over the house, but it seems whenever you want one, none can be found.  For this reason, I did like the nighttime pattern on the pacifiers; it helps my husband and I to remember that those are the 'bedtime binkies' and when we find them around the house, to put them back into her bed, so we *always* have a pacifier for bedtime.  Yes, the base of the pacifier is larger than Avent's 'regular' design, but I find that the larger base prevents the pacifiers from falling through the slats on my daughter's crib, which happens to the 'regular' design frequently.  Perfect if she wakes in the night; she can find her binkie and replace it herself - which she does.  I'm really pleased with these, as I have been with all Avent products I have purchased."	2/9/2011

"My 4.5 month old has started waking up all through the night looking for her paci.  She is just barely coordinated to get her paci back in about 1/3 of the time (that I see, although she probably finds it sometimes and I don't even know).  Since she has figured out how to roll over, she only sleeps on her belly.  Mam pacifiers are great for belly sleepers because they have a low profile and don't get knocked out of baby's mouth when she turns her head, and they are super light so they stay in easily.  I have sprinkled like 6 pacis around her head at night to increase the odds that she'll find one.  Until now, she had been using the under six month size, but I wanted to get the 6+ size to see what the difference is.  The shield is a bit larger and so is the nipple, and the nipple is more bulbous at the end.  I haven't noticed that she has an easier or harder time keeping them in than the smaller size.  She seems to not care which size I give her.  The glowing is genius.  Only the knob glows, not the shield or nipple, so the glowing part doesn't touch her face.  Makes it a snap for me to find in the night, and I'm hopeful that it helps her find them more often, too!  I held them under the light for like 10 seconds before I put her down, and they were much dimmer but still glowing 12 hours later."	10/13/2012

I saw someone with a WubbaNub after my first child had given up pacifiers.  I made sure to buy two of these for my second child and he loved it.

With my first during sleep training, I was constantly getting up in the middle of the night to make sure the pacifier stayed, and I feel like it my first heavily relied on the pacifier to go to sleep.  Now that I have this, the weight of the giraffe allows the pacifier to stay near #2's mouth - if she moves her head and loses the pacifier, she can easily find it, or it stays with her.  Also, #2 sucks on the pacifier then turns her head and goes to sleep - I feel like the fact that the pacifier is so near she can use it when needed but then spit it out and fall asleep.<br /><br />The actual product was smaller and more lightweight than I anticipated, but I do love this product.  I only leave it at home, and take different pacifiers out of the house."	2/22/2013

I chose Binkibear because I liked the idea of the detachable pacifier. As it turned out, I made a good choice because my grandson has never really cared much for pacifiers. He's 4-1/2 months now and he prefers chewing to sucking most of the time. This bear is at least twice as big as the other animals that have the attached pacifiers, making it the perfect size for an actual stuffed toy. He will pick it up off his play mat and hug it and chew on its arms or legs. Maybe when he has a bit more dexterity he'll put the pacifier in his mouth now and then. For now it is a cute, safe toy. He has other toys made for teething (He's not teething yet) but he prefers to chew on this bear and on the leg of a small stuffed cow I gave him."	3/3/2013

It's our go-to car seat pacifier.  It sits on her chest well, making it easier for her to recover after spitting it out accidentally and making it less likely to fall on the floor.  The elephant gives me something to easily grab from the drivers seat while reaching back as she cries on her way home from daycare.  Suprisingly, it also helped in her development of learning how to reach/grab and becoming more coordinated.  She's now four months old and still loves this Soothie pacifier, although she also uses MAM pacifiers in the house.  I held out for a couple months, but just gave in and purchased another WubbaNub last week.<br /><br />It would be wonderful if the pacifier could be separated from the animal for easier cleaning, but this doesn't deter me from recommending it to all of my friends."	2/8/2013

It kept slipping out of my daughter's mouth which is average size for a two-month old - perhaps it is the unimaginative design. The big suction hole in the front of the pacifier is unattractive as well - it looks like the paci is missing a plug or something.

We had trouble finding a pacifier that our son would take without a problem and we tried many different ones before finally getting this one. Our son loves it and we have been using them since he was a few weeks old (we are now on size 2). The pacifier is softer than the regular NUK and is shaped in a way that leaves more space for the tongue. It is also very light and has two slits on the sides to allow more air flow. Yes, it's true that the baby can fit the whole thing in his mouth (my son did it once when he was about 5 months old) but there is absolutely no way that he would be able to swallow it. Plus the slits on the sides would not allow him to suffocate either (the air or saliva can still flow freely). The baby can get a little scared if it got stuck in his mouth but that's about it. And by the way, many other pacifiers out there would fit in baby's mouth as well, so there is no reason to deem this one more dangerous than others.    This pacifier is worth every penny and I highly recommend it."	12/30/2010

Our week-old infant has taken to the GumDrops since day one, without nipple confusion or any other adverse effects.  They seem to comfort him immediately when I can't nurse him right away, and are the right size for his little newborn mouth.  Definitely gives me a few moments of peace knowing that he's comforted in someone else's arms while I prepare to feed him, and I appreciate the fact that they are hospital grade."	7/20/2010

My baby though would gag whenever she got the nipple into her mouth.  Not really sure why... but she never had Soothies in the hospital or anything and prefers the Avent pacifiers with the wider, flatter nipple.  Also, like many others have noted, it would have been nice if it could be sterilized.  I held the monkey over a pot of boiling water, being careful not to get the nose of the monkey too wet while the pacifier boiled.  Not sure how well it worked, but better than nothing!  The monkey could've been a bit heavier too, as it often fell off of my baby. (She's 4 months, so this would work way better for a kid still being swaddled.)"	1/20/2012

And I love how many models you can choose from! It is such a good idea to combine a pacifier with a plush toy. So cute, and so convenient to take in the car, or to give baby at night. I agree with people who say that the pacifier doesn't stay long in their kid's mouth: my baby, too, pulls the pacifier out of her mouth because she keeps grasping and playing with the giraffe. But that's ok with me, as long as she is having fun with it.<br /><br />However, I have to complain about the poor quality of this item:<br />- I saw someone writing that the plush looked like a happy meal toy. Yes, it does, indeed! It is soft enough for my baby to enjoy, but I still feel that for the price it could be somewhat nicer.<br />- The pacifier is not the best. The shape is actually pretty bad. The base of it shouldn't be round and have a 'cut-out' for the nose, like most other pacifiers do.<br />- I HATE that the plush doesn't detach, it makes it so much more difficult to wash. I would actually have liked it if you could detach the plush to wash it, and why not re-attach it to any pacifier, so that you could change the color of the pacifier, upgrade for a 6+ month pacifier, replace it when it is damaged, etc. I get that they don't want you to buy another brand of pacifier, but couldn't they at least make a system where you can remove and attach to this brand of pacifiers, and sell separate pacifiers and plush toys? Kind of a 'mix-n-match' concept? That would be sooooo great!<br /><br />Would these points be solved (and they are easily solved), it would be one of the best items on the market for a young baby. I also bought one for my godson and he loves his so much, too, but his mom has the exact same issues than I do. Anyhow, I don't regret my purchase but hope that Wubbanub will make this product better before I have another baby..."	3/23/2013

"Many of my friends had these and told me that their babies loved them so I bought one for my 3 month old son. I thought at first that the idea of this item was really great. A combination of a pacifier and stuffed animal seems like it would be so soothing! My son showed no interest in this item and even when I tried to introduce it as he grew he still wasn't impressed. He is 1 year old now and has never used this item. So I guess it depends on the child if they like it or not, but this is not why I am giving it two stars. I am giving it two stars (stars are for the good idea) because this item it almost impossible to clean. You cannot sterilize the pacifier and when you wash the stuffed animal you need to let it air dry (you can't put it in the dryer because of the pacifier).

WubbaNub should win a prize, for most awesome baby product for PARENTS!  Why parents? Because you finally do not have to get up every 2 min to put the soothie back in after your baby spits it up!<br /><br />My baby played a game called stupid soothie and mommy, where she would suck the soothie until mommy got back in bed, waited 2 min for mommy to get comfy, and BAM, spit it out, or with the help of her tiny long fingers, hurl the soothie right out of the crib.  I swear I would get up at least 20 times with each time I put her in the crib.  I was growing so frustrated.  Then while reading some forum, I kept seeing references to Wubbanub, due to the odd name, I looked it up, and it was like a bright light had shined on me!  I was saved!  I ordered one immediately, and life has been a bliss ever since!  My baby would also go into crying spells in the car, when I drove and the soothie fell out, and I had no way of getting it back into babies mouth asap.  The Wubbanub has stopped all of this drama.  The bear design in particular works better than some others, the month of the bear is bigger and holds the soothie down and in the mouth.  We also have the giraffe, and while cute, the mouth of giraffe where soothie is connected is thin and longer, and the soothie doesn't stay in quite as well as with the bear.<br /><br />Additional tip: if you put a blanket on top of the bear, it stays in even better, less risk of slipping out.  Also, after the initial wash/soothie boil, instead of boiling everyday and getting half the bear wet, I bought pacifier wipes that work well to get all the grime/germs off.<br /><br />This has seriously been a life saver!"	4/21/2013

We figure we should just stick with what we have instead of experimenting. We found a similar-looking one by Avent but they weren't the same. Thank goodness Amazon has these. They are exactly the same as the one we got from the hospital except the color but the engraving on the pacifier is all the same. The color for the blue ones is actually much lighter in person than in the picture -- more of a transparent grayish light blue; very pretty though.<br /><br />I personally like how it's one piece so I don't have to worry about loose pieces coming off -- choking hazard. The pacifier is really soft. I know they make harder ones for teethers but these are the softer ones for newborns and non-teething babies. It's very easy to clean and long-lasting. We're actually still using the green one we got from the hospital but having spares make it easier if I have to clean them then I don't have to worry about not having a pacifier available if it's being sterilized. I sterilizes them in boiling water and they stand up to the heat very well.<br /><br />These pacifiers does tend to get stuff like lint and hair stuck on them because of their sticky-ish surface. I don't use napkins or cloths with lots of fiber to wipe them otherwise they get fury. Most of the time I just run it through warm-hot water and maybe scrub it a little with my hands then let it air dry.	3/9/2011

"We had another pacifier that was given from the hospital. The one that we used was really good too except that it was too heavy for infants.

So we we went to BabiesRUs to get a new one. This is the one that we bought. It's pricy compared to other ones but we wanted to right one so we didn't have to waste money on trying out multiple pacifiers.   This one is great. It stays in!! The only thing that bothers me is that water does get into the pcifier and we have to clean it really thoroughly. However, if we shake the pacifier really well, the water will go out and as I observed the pacifier, the water will not get back to our son's mouth.   We got another one from Amazon so we have 2 handy. However, I would probably go back to the old ones when he can suck on something that's a little heavier."	6/11/2011

Having a video feed, in addition to the audio, is wonderful.  This monitor does an adequate job of displaying a good angle of the room and is pretty clear even in the near dark.  In my opinion, the video doesn't have to be high definition, but simply good enough to give an idea of what your kid is doing.  This monitor does the job, and does it well.<br /><br />2. After about 11 months of use, the monitor would not take a charge.  Playing around with it, I determined that the wall charger was fine, but the battery would not recharge, or continue to work even when plugged in.  Even though we may have been out of warranty (we received the monitor as a gift well before the twins arrived), I called Motorola and they agreed to replace the monitor for free.  Much more than I expected from customer service.  So although it failed, Motorola was responsive and took care of the problem.  Since then, we haven't had any problems.<br /><br />3. The user interface isn't perfect.  For example, we have twins and purchased an extra camera for a second room.  While we love the ability to add extra cameras, and the possibility of setting the monitor to automatically cycle through the cameras, for some reason you cannot change the video feed while the volume or brightness control is on the display.  And there is a huge lag in the time it takes for the volume control to clear the screen after you hit the button.  Often, we'll hear one kid crying, pick up the monitor and turn up the sound, and then have to wait several seconds for that to clear before changing to a different video feed.  While this may seem like user error, or a small inconvenience, I'll be the first to admit that we aren't always thinking clearly at 2 a.m., which also happens to be the time when I have the least patience for the volume control to clear so I can change feeds.  This isn't a deal breaker, but it keeps me from giving it five stars.<br /><br />4.  It has additional features, like the ability to play music and speak through a microphone to the camera.  I've never used these other than to make my wife jump when she is putting away the kids' laundry.  It doesn't detract from the product, but seems unnecessary to me.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like the best monitor for the price.

Now I give one to everyone I know of who is having a baby.  This product is so great, I'm sort-of surprised they aren't more widely available!"	11/12/2010

I bought the Wubbanub for my 4 week old son because he could not keep his paci in at night. The Wubbanub would still fall out if he didn't suck constantly but it was much better than before. It is lightweight but I think the reason is so it will fall out if he spits up. Now at 7 weeks it stays in his mouth better and he wraps his hands around it; so cute.  This is definitely a great solution for anyone tempted to prop the pacifier. I bought 1 for my in utero niece.	8/22/2008

The size is perfect and the different textures and colors are fun. When he was really little it was fun to watch him manipulate the monkey to get the pacifier back in his mouth.

"old review:  I bought these because my baby likes soothie pacifiers and I thought these were cuter.  As I read the packaging I saw they have a polycarbonate base surrounded by silicone.   BPA is used to make polycarbonate.  The BPA is surrounded by silicone, but if the silicone barrier fails you are giving your baby BPA to suck on.  I did notice the packaging very carefully says pthalate and latex free, but no mention of BPA because it is not BPA free.  Too bad because I do like them better than the soothies, but for me it's just not worth even the potential risk of spending a good part of the day sucking on BPA.  edited to add:  I noticed that they are now listed as BPA free on the website and emailed them.  They sent me back a note that they made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the ones with polycarbonate!  I found that very very reassuring and would now happily use them.   From their email:  Our GumDrop is BPA Free.  We had made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the GumDrop with the polycarbonate guard.

With our first child we used traditional pacifiers and we were constantly having to put it back in our child's mouth when it would fall out. But not the Wubba! This toy/pacifier is ingenious! It cuts down the need to replace it in the child's mouth drastically. If baby is sleeping with their head tilted to the side you can gently position Wubba so it is a prop up to hold the pacifier in baby's mouth. When baby is on their back looking up at the ceiling you place wubba on their chest and even if their little mouth relaxes and falls open during sleep, Wubba holds the pacifier gentaly in place so when baby seeks it -it is there! Before you know it little one will be holding on to it (great for helping to develop dexterity) and its too cute! We used to joke about how we wished there was a type of pacifier headgear...

"I have the lamb Wubbanub for my daughter and I bought this caterpillar as a shower gift for a friend. The shipping was very quick, maybe 2 days? The package was new, and it all looked clean and neat. She really liked it!  As for the product itself, I think Wubbies are really great pacifiers for different reasons. The toy serves the purpose as something to give the baby to do. My daughter likes to chew on her some and then she'll put the paci back in her mouth. Using the wubbie, she learned just how to put it back in her mouth, which is very nice. It's also hard to lose a wubbie! I hate searching underneath the crib, or in between a blanket or under a carseat for a single pacifier. They clean easily, just wash in the gentle cycle and air dry. They also get lots of compliments."	10/12/2010

"The Munchkin Healthflow Deluxe Bottle and Food Warmer is easy and convenient. Using the water measure is not an exact science and has been more of a trial and error process. I say error meaning that slightly too little water (lower measurement mark) just means the 2-3 oz of chilled formula warmed in a Ventaire 6 oz bottle is only luke warm...which doesn't seem to phase my infant when she is ready for a meal. Also, if the water measurement is filled over the upper mark, the bottle is still comfortably warm for feeding. My husband and I have not had a bottle that was too cold or too hot which is one less thing to worry and fuss about when we are half asleep fumbling in the kitchen in the middle of the night to feed our newborn.<br /><br />Because of the type of bottles we use, we occasionally have formula leak out from the bottom seal during the warming process. This is easy to clean even if it gets baked a bit from the warming plate by using the bottle scrubber, dish soap, and a paper towel to wipe it up. The leak can be avoided, by the way, if you take the cap off before heating so that the pressure escapes through the top (nipple) rather than the bottom (seal) of the Ventaire bottle.<br /><br />I do not know how the warmer will perform when the baby starts to drink more each feeding. If we continue to use ready-to-feed formula which needs to be chilled I imagine we might have to warm larger bottles twice before they are ready. More likely, we will switch to powdered formula and flouridated water at room temperature which will only need one time through the warmer.<br /><br />In summary: Four stars for a good product only because I anticipate having to be flexible with it's use."	2/20/2006

That doesn't effect the outside of it though. The plate of the pacifier has plenty of air holes to help with air circulation around the skin.

However, since we use it every night, I haven't folded it up since Week 1. I do like the tub but find it cumbersome to use. It does leak through one of the fold-up hinge/gaps if there's too much water in the tub. Also, Baby is now nearly 8 weeks old, and already, her feet spill over the end of the seat area. She's very nearly too big for it and measured 22 at her 6-wk checkup. I can't see her fitting in the tub much longer. Her feet do get stuck in the gaps between the seat and the side of the tub. More importantly, for some reason, there are hard plastic corners along either side of the pad where her head is. She's knocked her head on them several times, and any other time, we spend the whole bath on guard, hoping she doesn't knock it. I'm also bothered when draining the tub. The plug has a little rim around it that sits up. I'm sure this helps prevent leaks, but it also prevents all water from adequately draining out. I have to turn the tub completely upside-down to ensure that all water has drained. The more I think about it, the more I think I'd like to try a different tub. I'd recommend this tub only to those who are seriously crunched for space or who travel often and need a fold-up tub."	4/7/2005

The other reviews are right that the smaller bag is pretty small, you can't use it for diapers.<br /><br />The diaper bag did smell a little after holding a diaper for a couple hours, but we just throw the bag in the wash and it comes out just fine.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because it would have been nice if these had zippers, not drawstring. However, the drawstring does a good job so it's definitely not a deal breaker."	8/29/2010

"With my first daughter, she preferred this type of pacifier over any other pacifier that we tried to give her.  This is the same pacifier given in the nursery at the hospital, and when we got home, we purchased tons of them!  Well, needless to say, nowadays I couldn't tell you where even one of them is.  When I saw this cute little puppy that has the pacifier attached, I couldn't help but purchase it for my friend's coming up baby shower.  The pacifier, as I stated before, is the best!  And the attached puppy makes it so easy to keep track of!  The puppy is soft and cuddly, and perfect for boy or girl!<br /><br />The reason I gave it  4 stars instead of 5 is solely because, I've seen other versions of this product, and usually the stuffed animal is a little bigger.  Some may prefer the smaller size, but I think a little bigger in size would not only make it easier to keep track of, but offer a little more cuddling for the child."	2/17/2013

My daughter actually doesn't take a pacifier so I haven't used these much. I got the blue ones which is a little annoying. Why can't we pick our design?? I boiled these to sterilize and water got inside the pacifier. I don't think that makes it very sanitary later on. But I'm giving it 4 stars because of how cute they are and how flat they lay on my baby's face (when she took them. )	12/11/2012

Babies love it so they don't want to be separate from it and he is contstantly asking for it. It was the first pacifier he was introduced to so her will not take any other pacifier. This is a huge headache because its very hard to find them in some stores and when we lost it while on vacation we had a very very hard day.

What more could I say? This is my second Wubbanub purchase.I ordered one for DBG before she was born with hopes that she would take to it and she did!We have used our first one which was a small pink monkey now for nearly three months and it has been through a lot and still holding up.I wanted to have another as a back up.I ordered the ELLA BELLA Wubbanub because it was just too cute.We finally got it and I am very pleased with it.It is super soft and super cute.It is a good size not too small and not too big...just right and it's not heavy at all,just enough weight to it to help it stay where you want it to.I washed it and tried to give it to DBG and she would have nothing to do with it :( to my suprise.I decided to let her sleep with it for a few days along with her monkey Wubbanub and it worked! I realized that the reason she did not take to the new one at first was because it did not smell familar to her.Now she loves it as much as her monkey and I can wash the other one finally...as she will not do without one :) It is PERFECT in every way,it's a pacifier and her lovey/security,she will only take the pacifier when she's sleepy but she will grasp the legs and hold on tight and cuddle with it.BEST OF ALL: I don't have to dig for a paci EVER!It is so easy to find any time any where.She has a hard time holding one in her mouth(preemie) and this helps her to keep it there and when she does not want it she can just move her head and it falls out/away but stays with her.These are very durable.One of my baby shower gifts from now on.<br />Suggestion on washing:I take a mesh bag(zipped) or pillowcase(tied at the end) and drop the Wubbanub in and throw it in the washing machine on gentle cycle,let it air dry then wash the pacifier with warm/hot soapy water or use a pacifier wipe and we are good to go.<br />I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ITEM OR ANY WUBBANUB :)"	11/9/2012

I like that I can tuck the stuffed animal into my sons car seat straps to hold it in place.

(at least, mine does! i did wonder why previous customers didn't get their caps...)<br />2. portable! it's small enough to keep in a pocket, purse, pacifier bag... even a gladware 1/2-cup mini round storage container (the kind you can find at a supermarket or amazon, 8 units per pack [...]). yes, a sandwich bag will also do in a pinch.<br />3. easy to clean! each piece -- silicone spout, green \\neck\\ and clear cap -- are extremely easy to handwash using the smaller nipple brush attachments that most people have. if water's the only thing that you use it for, there's less of a worry about scrubbing off juice bits.<br />4. compatible! for poland spring bottles, the adapter works if the green \\neck\\ is screwed with the logo upside down. although the directions do say this clearly, i'd say it here too: if the adapter doesn't work with the particular water bottle you have, try re-inserting the spout through the green neck but in the opposite direction so that the logo on the green neck appears upside down. the green \\neck\\ is threaded on both ends, expanding its compatibility with a range of water bottles.<br />edit oct. 2011: compatible with the platypus platy soft bottle with closure cap. this product combo has proven to be a very convenient way to carry baby's drinking water.<br/>5. chewable! my baby likes chewing thoughtfully on the silicone spout between sips. no damage yet, to baby or bottle cap adapter. but i'm sure green sprouts will warn against treating this adapter as a toy. it's not a toy, okay?<br />6. no leaks! if the adapter is screwed on correctly for the water bottle you have (and assuming the two are compatible), turning the water bottle upside down does not create a shower. if anything, it's hard to get liquid out... see drawback above."	9/22/2011

When your baby gets to be old enough to bring things to his/her mouth, these binkies are very easy to get in!  There's no upside-down (like there is with most orthodontic pacifiers), and there's no floppy hook in the way.<br />2.  They're weighted extraordinarily well, and when they fall 90% of the time, they land without touching the nipple to the ground!  This is an enormously valuable feature!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  They're a little hard to come by, so when you find them, you've got to stock up!  I can only find the 6 mo size at Walgreens and my local grocery stores.<br />2.  They're more pricey than others.  (worth it, tho!)<br />3.  You can't pick the colors when ordered from Amazon.  I lucked out and got blue for my boy, but I could have received pink."	8/1/2011

"I loved that my baby can hug the small stuffed animal and tuck the pacifier. She loved it. It is machine washable and as soon as you take it out, it does not really need to be dried as it is dried already and is ready to be used.<br />I thought it was a bigger giraffe and was disappointed at first to see it so tiny, but I believe it is the appropriate size for an infant not to choke on. It is a pricey ($13-$14 ea.). Wish it was half price, and wish I could replace pacifiers on the stuffed animal, but can not, since it is sewed with stitches to the giraffe.<br /><br />BabyHaven is really professional and nice. When I received other regular Soothie pacifiers in damaged boxes, they offered to send me replacements for free. Hoping to receive them soon by mail.<br />----------------------------------------<br />Edited April 8, 2013:<br />I now have an Amazon Prime Membership with my Amazon Mom membership, I receive everything in 2 days and can return items with no hassle. Back when I bought the Wubbanub and Avent Soothie Pacifiers from BabyHaven, I thought they proposed to send me free pacifiers to replace the damaged packages I received but they did not and wanted me to pay for the return shipping rate. They said since product is not damage it is my responsibility. They tucked 6 Avent soothie pacifiers and 3 wubbanub pacifiers in one small bubbly envelop!!! The Avent Soothie's package was ruined but they did not care.<br />They were not so professional what so ever.<br /><br />We are treated better when we get the Prime Membership as we deal with Amazon directly versus with the seller. Packaging is better, as they send in a boxes even small ones versus in an envelop that gets ur package damaged from shipping.<br /><br />Would still recommend the product though. My daughter stopped taking the pacifier around 4 months, but she loves to play with the tiny stuffed animal and chew on it sometimes :) So cute!"	12/21/2012

We had a WubbaNub already on hand, and were happy to discover that the nipple is the same as is used in many NICU's. Having the weight of the stuffed toy rest on his chest meant less times of getting up to replace the soother for him. As he grew, he was able to grab the soother in the middle of the night to use on his own. He now plays primarily with the stuffed toy. Since he's older and rougher on them, we purchased a few more to ensure we had replacements. We are overall very happy with the products and the designs, but one of the ones we purchased was missing a lot of the stuffing and was exceptionally dirty. We ended up throwing it away. Not sure if this was a one-off or if they are randomly different weights."	11/11/2011

He loved Soothie he got from the hospital but he kept dropping it. I wanted to get this one so that my son could hold it. He absolutely loved it! He went everywhere with it. He also played with it like a toy. Most of the time,this paci was the only way to calm my son down. I washed it in the regular washing machine with rest of his clothes and dried it in a drier with high temp many times and it was still fine. I ended up buying total 4 of them for my son. The difficult part was to get rid of this pacifier from him. He didn't go to sleep with out it. He became so fussy without it. However, last month when my son was 20 month-old, he chewed the soothie badly and tier all of them off. I didn't buy another one for him but I gave him a little teether just to keep something in his mouth when he gets fussy. First 3 days without this paci were very rough but he became fine without it after a few days. Now he is 21 month old, and still chews on teether a few times a day just for a little bit, but he is completely pacifier-free. I am very happy.

I have used them for my baby since he was about a month old. He is almost 5 months old now. They seem to work great! I love the size. I tried a few other brands and my baby just would not take them. They were all too long or the shape was one he didn't like. These seem to be the shape and length that he likes. I actually bought a ton of these because the baby kept dropping them everywhere. I seriously will not buy any other kind. They don't have these in the store so I have to purchase them on Amazon and just wait for them to be shipped.

Second, the puppy has saved the paci part from many falls (no 5 second rule needed).  Third, the dog sits on my daughter's chest while in her chair or in bed, so if she spits out the paci, it doesn't go far (and she is often able to retrieve it on her own).  Fourth, it's much harder to lose the paci when there is an adorable puppy attached.  The price is reasonable; the construction is very durable; and the dog is doggone cute.

We stumbled upon the first one by accident and have been hooked ever since.  These have a Soothie pacifier with an attached animal.  The animal helps newborns keep the pacifier in their mouths.  As the baby grows the animal makes the pacifier easy for them find in the dark and it doubles as a 'lovey.'      The only draw back is the animal is permanently attached.  I have found the easiest way to clean it is to put it in the washing machine.  Do not put it in the dryer (this breaks down the pacifier).  I recommend having several wubbanubs so one can be washed while the baby uses the others.  You should regularly check the pacifier for tears and discard when it gets old and worn.    I recommend having several Wubbanubs.  I keep 1 at day care, 1 in the car, 1 in the diaper bag for back up, and 1 or more in the crib.  This way I don't have to go searching when the baby is crying.  I also keep several on hand to give as baby shower gifts."	8/6/2009

Highly recommend you at least try it if you haven't already. It's great, because you can stick your finger in and babies tend to latch onto it better when you do.<br /><br />And they look like a suckerfish, as you can see by looking down the translucent nub. It's entertaining AND useful.<br /><br />And I totally don't laugh at my child.<br /><br />---------UPDATE 10/18/2013----------<br />My second son is now four months old and he has never once liked these pacifiers. It is true that all babies are different, and they all have mouths of different shapes and sizes. It always seems like it is awkward for him to latch onto the soothies (I've tried both the 0-3 month and next size up). They work okay if we can hold our finger there, but once we let go he spits it right out.<br /><br />I am leaving my rating at five stars because they were still a lifesaver with my first-born. They are a quality product made out of a sturdy material, and the shape is brilliant (it is never going to get swallowed). I also recommend trying a few types, though. NUK is his favorite.

"This stroller is nice looking and fine for mall shopping, but if you are doing anything outside in the sun or light rain, it's terrible. The canopy is so small and doesn't cover anything which is terrrible when you go to the zoo! I have had two of them and both, I had to return because the wheels kept sticking. The first was the 04 then I had the 05 thinking that they might have fixed the problem. They didn't. Other customers are right in that when the seat is in recline position there is almost no way to access the basket. So if your child is sleeping or you have an infant seat on top, you can forget about accessing anything you have stored in the bottom. It is a decent stroller, is rated top by consumer reports, and comfy for the child, but to me, it's not worth the price.  <br /> <br />If you only want it for those mall shopping trips where you don't buy a lot, then it's probably perfect for you!"	4/8/2005

(the one that comes with it no longer works for us as when in place it pulls my daughters long legs tight against the stroller which obviously she hates.)  this xl stroller has a longer than average  stroller canopy so i have found most generic weather shields are too short over the top resulting in the shield looking odd (as the corners aren't on the corners at all but up an inch on to the roof of the stroller hood) & consequently losing inches in length of coverage for the front.  (jeep standard stroller weather shield does just this and is also very flimsy.  ripped at one joint first time i put it on!) this shield just about works.  i have found that if you attach from the second set of velcro fastenings down it will do a passable job of fitting.  it has a longer front than any other i have tried and finishes only  2-3 inches away from the foot support. it also seems quite sturdy, unlike the jeep cover it doesn't feel like it will rip at the seams. i have no doubts it will flap around a bit in the wind (although it is anchored well around the back of the stroller with decent velcro fastenings) but as i'm more concerned about rain this is fine for me.  all in all i think this is a good shield for the price."	3/7/2013

"I purchased a Wendy B crib set for my son(now 15 mos. old) before she affiliated with BRU. Obviously I paid way more at the specialty store where I bought it. I have now chosen this set for my baby girl due in June. The most awesome thing about her sets is the 4 pc. slipcovered bumpers. I have looked everywhere and cannot find any other manufacturer who offers this. So the colors aren't EXACTLY what I was hoping for--so what! You need to think more about the functionality of your choices for baby's nursery more than the cosmetics, especially with more than one child. You may not appreciate it until your baby has their first bout with a stomach virus--some of you know what I mean! It is so convenient to be able to unzip the slipcovers off the bumper and throw them in the washer & dryer without ruining your entire crib bumper. It's also great if you need to wash only one section. Also, when your child gets too tall for a bumper, you can simply remove the section(s) where they could use it to climb out. My son is huge for 15 mos. and loves to use the 3 sections of the bumper still in his crib as pillows to lay on. The quality is excellent and this set will outlast the time your child is in the crib. If you don't like the feel of the sheet, go out and buy some extra sheets that coordinate with the set (that's what I did the first time). I feel there is no better choice than Wendy B. and we're lucky they're readily available at BRU vs. paying boutique pricing!"	4/7/2005

"I have the Chicco Cortina travel system and that stoller is very hard to maneuver - it is big and also not easy to control. This Contours Lite Stroller is awesome - lightweight and so easy to control.  I can push it one-handed and easily turn it, which is great when going in or out of a heavy swinging door (like at the doctor's office). Great storage underneath. Pretty easy to adjust up and recline down, although harder to push up with a baby in it.  I have 4 main complaints:  - The strap between the baby's legs is a simple narrow strap so it kind of digs into him. He is cushioned by a diaper, but he is definitely applying pressure to the strap because the back always forces the baby to be semi-reclined  - only a single cup holder for the parent - no place to put keys, phone, etc. I bought a separate caddy [[ASIN:B000SMWUPS Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy]] that velcros onto the handlebar and that works well, but that was an extra $15 or so.  - The canopy sort of snaps open because it resists opening and then all of a sudden opens. Same with closing, but slightly less dramatic snap. When my baby is sleeping, I hate to be opening or closing the canopy since it's so loud. But my baby generally sleeps though it so it's not much of a problem.  - The shoulder straps are difficult to adjust, or at least I haven't figured out how to do it. If you can't just grab something and intuitively figure out how to adjust it, it's not a good design.  The price is great ($54 or so) and it is light and easy to maneuver, so it generally suits my purposes. I may add padding to the crotch strap as my baby gets older."	12/4/2011

"This arrived in the mail yesterday - My daughter is due in 5 weeks and I've read so many great reviews on these little things that I just had to buy one for her. When it came I was surprised at how SMALL it really is!<br /><br />When you look at photos of other people's photos of their babies holding these they look pretty decent in size, like this would be something that baby could use as a stuffed animal in a year or so, once they are off a pacifier. We ordered the lamb one, and with the pacifier off of it (It'll just take a few scissor snips to take it off), it looks like it could be a toy for a dog!<br /><br />It's so darn cute and tiny though... My 8lb poodle saw it come out of the bag an immediately sat in front of me, thinking it was a new toy for her. We've put it in the nursery and now she sits at the door waiting to go in so she can try and find it. (haha!) I will update this after baby arrives and we have a chance to use it, but I am hopeful that it will be a big success!<br /><br />UPDATE 9/14/12<br /><br />My daughter is 7 weeks now and she loves this thing. We recently took it on a trip to CA, and I make sure it's always in her diaper bag when we leave the house. We also have the blue bear one of these that stays at home as well. It's been great to keep it in her mouth when sleeping (she's a tummy sleeper), and when in the baby carrier, I don't have to worry about her dropping it and losing it in the carrier!<br /><br />Also - Our cousin has about 9 of these ones for his son, and they love them as well!"	6/28/2012

My baby took to it so well that it became the only one she wanted. So we chose the pink elephant for an extra pacifier. She loves them both equally and both are really cute. It's not hard to spot clean the animal part & wash the pacifier part. At 2 months baby would sometimes get ahold of the legs & pull it out of her mouth to her dismay but now at 3 months she can grab ahold of it & stick it into her mouth if she wants. She also likes just holding onto the toy part. Highly recommend this pacifier.	2/18/2013

It was cute and I understood it's function from the beginning beyond just having a pasi.  However it wasn't until I opened the package yesterday that I was disappointed (I'm due soon); the directions say to wash the pasi - got it, no biggie.  The animal - wash gentle dry low, got it.  Then as I was inspecting the product I realized the animal is sewn together WITH the pasi.<br /><br />This didn't make sense to me.  So you're supposed to wash the animal in the washer, with the pasi attached to it, allowing any soap you might use in the washer to soak into the pasi.  Or you could not use any detergent but either way I'm sure the pasi can't be washed in a washer too frequently.<br /><br />You can't remove or reattach the pasi unless you take the stitch out and then restitch the (or a new) pasi into the mouth of the animal.  I was expecting some clip or tie or something else other than permanent attachment of the two objects; for cleaning purposes this is completely unpractical.<br /><br />I gave it two stars instead of just one because it is adorable. It is another baby-item that may or may-not work depending on how my child takes it.  The rating is not based upon if my kid throws it or not because that would defeat the purpose of rating the product as-it-is verses what my kid does with it."	3/13/2011

First, the pacifier that comes with the toy is flimsy, it's not the same quality as the actually one that you buy separately. Also, the way it is sewn on to the mouth of the toy, it pulls the pacifier out of the baby's mouth making it even more difficult for the baby to hang on to it then if it was just a pacifier without the toy.

"My husband and I were given two orange newborn GumDrop pacifiers in the hospital and found that our daughter took to them quickly as she needed the additional suckling time and I couldn't be her permanent pacifier.  Before we found that our daughter prefers the GumDrop, we tried the following pacifiers (because we received a ton at my baby showers):   1) Philips Avent Soothie Pacifier - look similar to GumDrop, but doesn't have the nook cutout around the nose  2) NUK latex pacifier and the Nuk silicone - have the angled tip upwards  3) various MAM pacifiers - shorter oval sized stem and silicone  4) Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier - angled tip upwards    Our daughter preferred silicone to latex and wasn't picky at first, but once she hit 6 months, she wouldn't take any of the others than her GumDrop!  We don't give out 5 stars easily unless we really love something, but these GumDrop pacifiers are the best.  One thing to note - I wasn't sure what the difference was between the newborn vs. full-term GumDrop pacifier - newborn was what we received in the hospital on the package but it said full-term on the ones we ordered here on Amazon.  From what we can tell, we believe the only difference is the thickness/consistency of the silicone.  The newborn ones appear to be a little thinner/softer type of silicone and the full-term ones are a little thicker/sturdier perhaps since they chew harder especially now that there are teeth!  There is no difference in the length of the stem or the overall shape of the pacifier.  We purchased the natural scent as we thought that was safest and we just make sure to wash them often so they don't get the plastic type of smell pacifiers sometimes carry.  But next time we may try to order the vanilla scent just to see what the difference may be.    Pros:   - Love the nose cut-out because they can breathe easily without interference and it is made to conform to their face comfortable - not like the Soothie that takes up their whole face!- Hole for stem is easy for her to put her finger through when she wants to chew on something with some substance  - Medical-grade silicon -> dishwasher safe  - One piece of silicone is easy to clean and doesn't collect in hard-to-reach crevices  - Soft and pliable -> no nipple confusion when breastfeeding  - Firm enough that your little one can chew away but lightweight  - Hole that you can loop a pacifier strap through it to attach to their clothes  - Available in four colors: pink, purple, orange and blue    Cons: NONE!*  *One we received from the hospital recently cracked (after 7.5 months of use) as she liked to chew on all sides of them now that she can grab them herself and she was bending them backwards (against the way they are made to fit smoothly against their face).  I tried giving her one of the others we had until I could order some GumDrops and she put them in her mouth, immediately pulled them out and laid them on the ground all in a matter of two seconds.  That's why I think the full-term are helpful because it's a sturdier silicone likely better equipped for older babies/toddlers.    Just recently we saw [[ASIN:B004IOHN8Q The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant Pacifier, Pink/Purple]] are now sold at Target and they have the same shape and appear to be almost identical to these but these also are offered in one more color, green.  I did buy some just to see if they were different and I noticed the difference in the thickness of the silicone in these much clearer than the ones on Amazon.  The First Years 0-3 months version is softer/thinner/more pliable than the 3+ months version which is a thicker/sturdier silicone.  The best price is still on Amazon, but still a good back up if you're ever in a bind."	7/8/2011

US	17597890	R3HBNJDSAV5OGO	B001G4YULO	531834407	the first years gumdrop pacifier wipes	Baby	3	2	2	N	Y	Great Idea But Not Our Favorite	"The idea of the product is great. These are wipes that you can use to clean pacifiers, sippy cups, bottle nipples, teethers, or whatever if they happen to fall on the ground (or get thrown...) and you are nowhere near a source of water or soap and can rinse things. They come in a convenient little package, they are disposable, and fit into a diaper bag along with the several other different types of wipes a mom must carry around with her.<br /><br />I purchased these initially from Amazon once, because I had never seen them in stores. Immediately after receiving them in the mail I noticed them in stores, for a significantly lower price than what I had paid. So I stopped buying them on here. I also now prefer [[ASIN:B004HM368U Munchkin 36 Pack Arm and Hammer Pacifier Wipes, White]] instead of the First Years ones.<br /><br />First of all, these are indeed wonderful for when you are not near soap and water and can't rinse things off. But for most people, that is not really often enough to justify the purchase of the wipes or having to carry them around with everything else crammed into a diaper bag. In most situations where I couldn't rinse off something in a sink I didn't have these wipes, I usually had a bottle of water I could pour over the item to rinse it. That's not to say that these aren't useful if maybe you are on a long road trip with few rest areas where you can buy water or rinse things in a bathroom sink, or if you are camping, or if your baby is screaming in the middle of the store and you need to sanitize her pacifier quickly and don't have time to dash to the restroom to use the soap and water. In such cases, these are very useful. But its not an everyday occurrence and something to think about before stocking up on multiple packs.<br /><br />There is the issue with the chemicals and the possible residue. That is why I like the Munchkin brand better now, because these left a sort of oily feeling residue and the Munchkin ones left none. But I do prefer an oily residue over possible bacteria or fungus that might have otherwise been on the item. They have an odd scent which I think is some sort of sugary flavor left on the cup or toy or whatever so the baby doesn't taste the cleaning chemicals. I'm not sure if that bothers me or not, as it is probably a necessary evil. Unfortunately it seems that my daughter didn't like the taste because after using the wipes she never wanted her pacifier, and made a disgusted face when pulling it out of her mouth. She stopped using her pacifier at 3 months. So maybe use these to wipe your pacis down when you are trying to wean your child off them.<br /><br />All things considered, these are pretty good for situations when there is no soap and water, but these are definitely not a replacement for soap and water.an oily residue over possible bacteria or fungus that might have otherwise been on the item.

So you really cannot sterilize the binky and washing it gets the monkey all wet, which you're not supposed to do.  I still like it.      edited- oops, I didn't read the tag correctly.  Turns out you can throw the whole thing in the laundry.  Works great."	12/9/2009

So now is used as a toy, they like to test their motor skills with it, just don't put it in their mouths.<br />What I liked about the product:<br />- It's BPA free, but honestly, most baby product are.<br />- Doesn't have cracks which makes it easy to wash.<br />- it's made out of rubber. This is convenient if your baby likes to fall asleep with it and then rolls over it.<br /><br />What I don't like about the product:<br />-did you look at the price??? $9 for a pacifier is a little too much. Particularly when pacifiers are a hit or miss kind of a thing.<br />-it does have a funky smell at first.<br /><br />In my opinion this product is not worth it. Is way too expensive for what it is and there are a lot of reasonably priced products out there. Keep in mind that if your baby likes it you'll need a few to keep around.

For the first few weeks it was a useful item.  We would swaddle her in a kiddopotomous, and put her in here and she would sleep very well.  Around a month, she started getting wrestless about being swaddled so we used a baby blanket.  She started outgrowing this at about 5 weeks - we would find her with her head hanging off the top of the incline.  I adusted the side supports so it was a little more snug, and farther down so that her head wouldn't slide off.  Within a couple of days I woke up to find her under the blanket with her head between the two side supports.  This to me is more dangerous than allowing her to sleep on her tummy!  We were leary of potential suffocation!  Our baby is currently 7 weeks old, I feel this was a waste of money considering it was only useful for a month.  This product needed to be made about 6 inches longer, and the side supports needed to be made with a mesh fabric for breathability just in case the baby wiggles her way down.  Good idea, but needs improvement."	4/7/2005

I'm not sure what it was. It was really gross.  I returned it to amazon and also emailed nuby just letting them know.  I don't know how it got inside of the packaging.  Other than that, the pacifiers are decent. I have a few others that are identical i bought elsewhere.  It's nice that the water can't get trapped in the nipple like so many other pacifiers, but there is still something to hold onto.  I have a baby boy and of course, like others, received pink and purple in color.  Annoying, but I'd just use around the house if I had to. But as it was, I would never use them because of the dead bug or seed and dirt inside of it.  I would have rated higher on the pacifiers themselves, if they were clean. I took a picture and sent to nuby, so maybe will attach here some day if I figure out how."	9/18/2012

I decided to give this one a try, hoping that maybe if the paci fell out, it would still stay close enough for her to get back in her mouth on her own.  No such luck.  Also, when she starts vigorously sucking, she gets all excited and starts to pull on the animal, causing the paci to come out.  My sister had one of these with her DS a couple years ago, but I remember the animal being a little more weighted than this pink bear... per another reviewer, perhaps the quality has changed a bit over the years?<br /><br />The nice things about this paci is that it's cute as heck.  Also, when the paci does fall out of her mouth, it doesn't go too far - a problem I had with the paci alone falling on the floor and then me needing a few backups on hand in case I couldn't wash it right away.  I think this would be great for on the go - less likely for this bigger thing to fall out of the carseat (I don't think I quite trust a paci leash with my DD being this little).<br /><br />The one thing I don't like about this is that you can't remove the paci from the animal, so it makes washing a little tricky.  I'm used to having to sterilize everything daily for a preemie and this one you can't really throw in the dishwasher or in the steam basket.  The only way to sterilize is to dip it in boiling water and trying not to get the animal wet.  Based on reviews, doesn't sound like a good idea to throw this guy in the washing machine.  Plus, I'm not sure if I would want my DD's paci in the washing machine anyways.<br /><br />I am hoping as she gets a little bigger and if we decide to stick with a paci, that this will work out better for us.  But at little over 2 months (over 2 weeks gestation), it's not quite as great as I had hoped.  Keeping my fingers crossed that it soon will!"	2/20/2013

These receiving blankets are superior to all the other brands we own.<br /><br />They are larger than brands bought from Kohls and Wal-mart. They are a solid 30 x 40 inches which is more than adequate for wrapping up a small infant. None of the other brands came close to this size and they drew up substantially in the wash on the first washing. Not so with these Carter blankets. They can handle multiple washings with little shrinkage.<br /><br />I don't know about you but receiving blankets take some abuse here. When you have a newborn, I've found that anything will do in a pinch...so receiving blankets get put through the ringer as towels and burp cloths, etc. These blankets seem well equipped for the job. Overall, they are of great quality.<br /><br />They are pretty shades of 100% cotton flannel in mixed prints of brown and pink. They are soft on baby's skin.<br /><br />I am happy to have bought these in two sets. They are a little hard to find online sometimes and I wish I had bought a couple more sets."	7/28/2012

"these bags made all of my wildest breastmilk pumping and storing dreams come true!  i would give them 6 or 7 stars.<br /><br />they combine all of the good features of the other brands into one product, with none of the flaws that the other products have.<br /><br />i love these bags!<br /><br />okay, so here's the low down on these:<br /><br />- this is the new version of honeysuckle's breastmilk bags, which are designed to be used with a pump--you just pump right into them.<br /><br />the bags have little holes on the top part, so that you can attach them to a pump adapter.  so, for the full experience, you need a pump adapter or two, which you can get by purchasing a pack of bags made by your pump's manufacturer.  i bought these medela bags: [[asin:b007pexokw medela pump & save breastmilk bags with easy-connect adapter - 50 ct]] because i have a medela pump.  i don't know if adapters are interchangeable between brands.  then, use the medela bags if you want, so that you're not wasting, and so that you know how wonderful these honeysuckle bags are when you start using them.  whether or not you use the bags, keep the little plastic adapters.<br /><br />then get some of these honeysuckle breast pump bags, and you'll see how perfect they are.<br /><br />medela vs. honeysuckle<br />all right, so here are the reasons that i like this bag better than the medela bags:<br />1. the plastic is not as rigid as the medela bags, yet it is still thick enough that you don't have to worry about it.<br />2. get this: the honeysuckle bags fit the medela easy adapter better than the medela bags do!  with the medela bags, you have to put them on at just the right angle, and it's kind of a tight fit.  then removing the bags after you've pumped is...well, interesting.  the honeysuckle bags are easy to put on, and they still stay put while you're pumping, but then they are easy to remove when you're done.<br />3. the honeysuckle bags can be stored flat in the freezer so that it is easier to store more, instead of having a bunch of squatty bags like the medela ones.  or, you can store them upright if you prefer.  another nice thing about storing them flat is that they defrost more quickly when you're ready to use them.<br />4. the honeysuckle bags can fit more milk.  they are marked to 6 oz (medela is marked to 5 oz), but since they can be stored flat, there is also just a bunch of extra space.  so, if you fill a little more it doesn't create any problem.  the medela bags get kind of messy if you put any more than 5 oz.<br />5. the honeysuckle bags have two seals.  medela only has one, and it doesn't always seal perfectly.<br />6. the honeysuckle bags are much, much less expensive than medela bags: right now (based on the cost of packs of 50 bags on amazon) honeysuckle bags are about 23 cents each and medela bags are 40 cents each.  so, medela bags are almost double the cost of honeysuckle bags.<br /><br />those are the things that come to mind.<br /><br />lansinoh vs. honeysuckle<br />1. the lansinoh bags cannot attach to a pump directly.  so, you either have to pump into something else first or hold the bag the whole time you pump.<br />2. the seams on the lansinoh bags are thin--honeysuckle's seams are very thick, so you really don't have to worry about them splitting at all.<br />3. lansinoh bags are meant to be stored flat, which is great, but they are awkward to try to stand up (when you're filling them or actually using them). honeysuckle bags can also be stored flat, but they have a special bottom of the bag that makes it so that it can stand up well too.<br />4. lansinoh bags are partially sealed at the top, which is supposed to reassure us that the bags are sterile.  honeysuckle bags are completely sealed at the top, which is much more reassuring.<br />5. the label area on lansinoh bags is upside down (so that they are right-side up while in the freezer, maybe?).  regular honeysuckle bags have the writing right-side up, which i think is nice---but! these pump bags have no writing, so you can do your own thing, and if you want to put it right-side up or upside down, either will work.<br />6. lansinoh bags are considered the cheap brand; right now on amazon each bag works out to about 21 cents.  at only 23 cents each right now, honeysuckle bags are very comparable in price, while the quality is far superior.<br /><br />i am aware that there are a few other brands of bags out there, but i haven't tried them.  i started with medela bags, switched to lansinoh but didn't even finish the package of those, switched back to medela, started buying non-pump honeysuckle bags--which are also very good, and just heard about these.  i won't be switching brands again, because i can't think of anything i would want to be different.<br /><br />if you're considering these bags, i definitely recommend that you buy them.  you won't regret it.  the only thing that is kind of a pain about them is that they are not available in any stores near me, so i have to get them online.  that just means i have to plan ahead a little, but i can handle that.  every time i order bags from honeysuckle (this was my third order), i have received them within a few days, so shipping time is also minimal.ice---but!

"i got the woombie to replace a miracle blanket, which my 3-month-old daughter is growing out of (and which comes only in newborn - 3 month size).  i was so hoping it'll work, but it didn't.  it just got my baby frustrated - she could move her arms, got her hands close to her mouth, but couldn't get them into her mouth (besides, i think her arms got stuck in this position, and she couldn't move them down).  the miracle blanket uses two levels of restraint - first the arms get pinned down alongside the body, then the baby is wrapped all around.  no moving arms there.  my daughter loves this blanket, frequently falls asleep on her own (some times after 5 min of fussing, sometimes right away) if wakes she up while i put her down, and always falls back asleep if she wakes up in the middle of the night or a nap.  with the woombie, she started whimpering when i put her down and the whimpers quickly turned into crying, as she was trying to get her arms somewhere, where they wanted to go.  this swaddling blanket is supposed to mimic the womb.  well, maybe if you start using it on a newborn and then graduate to the larger side it would work.  but by 3 months, perhaps, the womb experience is too remote for the baby to need to replicate it."	12/9/2011

Keep that in mind if u order these pacifiers since you can't choose the colors order something else with them with the color gender of you child it might help the person who's picking out your items in wear house.

"In true breastfeeding fashion, we waited until our son was four weeks old before offering any pacifiers to make sure we had good attachment and technique down (don't really believe in nipple confusion, but it helps everyone involved not to be stuffing a newborn's mouth with a pacifier from day one).  One we passed that magic milestone of four weeks, we opened our new Wubbanub and a fast appreciation was had--babies love to suckle!  It calms them and allows them to gather themselves in the middle of a meltdown.  It is great to carry them through to the next feeding when they get older if you are trying to sleep train.  My son falls asleep within minutes when I put him down in his crib, awake with the Wubbanub--he always spits it out after he is asleep, but no need to restuff his mouth.  The little monkey legs and arms lay on the chest and help the pacifier stay put.  He also loves to grab it with his hands and arms in a big hug.

"My son has had some sort of break out or allergic reaction to regular pacifiers since he was around 3 months old.  I have tried EVERYTHING you could possibly think of to clear it up.  Medications, creams, pacifiers with more vents, all different brands, latex, silicone, and even tried breaking him of using a pacifier all together.  He would have red bumps on the area around his mouth that would sometimes form blisters, crack, and bleed.  At 6 months old I finally bought these pacifiers as my last resort and since using them we have not had any breakouts at all!!<br />It has been wonderful for my son and me."	4/10/2012

I live in Singapore and it took a while for the package to reach me and in the interim managed to find a more traditional style pacifier from Pidgeon but  with an olive shaped teat.  It's possible I would think more highly of the soothie if I had not tried the Pigeon pacifier first.  My baby  will take the soothie but does not prefer it over the pigeon one.  The problem with the Soothie is that it falls out of his mouth really easy.  If he lets up sucking for a moment it falls out of his mouth.  If it happens to roll out of his cot (which seems to happen more frequently than a regular pacifier) it always lands teat side down (regular pacifiers are more likely to land teat side up).  Additionally there is no cover for the soothie and it is more difficult to teather to a stroller or car seat so it is not a great pacifier to travel with.  In short:  I will use the soothies as back-ups as baby will take them but will not be buying more as a regular pacifier with an olive shaped teat is better	2/2/2012

However, the results weren't any different from all the other pacis we tried. Maybe it works for younger babies but at 2 months, it would still fall out of his mouth when he turned his head so it didn't really keep it in place. To be fair, maybe my little one just isn't a pacifier kind of kid, which is fine, but we didn't have the success that so many others seem to have with this product.

The little lamb (and it is little) is precious and you can't help but say awww when you first see it.  It's a great concept, and any parent that has played the retrieve the binky game is hoping it will work.  So far for us it's been about 50% successful.  The little lamb's feet are slightly weighted, so if our daughter is lying still in her rumble chair and you get the binky in her mouth and the lamb spread out right it does work.  The problem is at 11 weeks she's not exactly lying still all that often but she doesn't have the hand control to hold on to the lamb.  She still has the whole arms-swinging-wildly startle reflex going, so more often than not she knocks the lamb, which pops the binky out of her mouth, defeating the whole purpose.  She can't control her hands enough yet to then get it back in.<br /><br />On the upside, it does prevent the binky from rolling off onto the floor and it makes it much easier to find and put back in her mouth.  I can see the potential for this product and hope when she gets older and can actually hold on to the lamb it will work.  I'm giving it a 3 star rating for now for cuteness and potential and hope to upgrade to a 4 or 5 star rating in the future.<br /><br />Update: A year later and I'm afraid this little lamb never really worked out for us.  By the time my daughter had enough hand control to no knock the lamb out she was keeping a binky in her mouth more readily and she would grab this little guy to examine and again, pull the binky out of her mouth.  We ended up using binky leashes, which were perfect for our needs.  She recently rediscovered this little guy, and while she's too big to need him, she did enjoy popping the binky in and out of her mouth a few times holding the lamb, but then became angry that the lamb wouldn't give up his prize. =)  At this point, this guy is holding on to one star from us for sheer cuteness and one for what COULD be a great idea for another child, but I'm afraid he never quite worked out for us.  (We have friends who swear by him however, so it may work for your child.)<br /><br />As a note: it would be nice if there was some way to attach and detach the binky.  If she had used this frequently I could see it getting dirty and needing to be washed, which would be tricky without getting laundry detergent on the binky.  On the reverse side, you would want to wash the binky with dish soap but not the lamb.  The only decent solution is to handwash, and what busy parent has time for that?  (Plus at my daughter's current age I could see her loving to carry this little guy around if she could get the binky out of his mouth and it would have been nice to have given the toy a second life.)"	12/31/2011

However, it was made with such poor quality material & so badly designed that it is really a huge waste of money.   The plastic on the outside is so brittle, that if it falls on a hard surface, such as concrete, it is prone to shattering, leaving sharp, jagged edges that you would never put near your baby's mouth. Also, it doesn't take long before the closure no longer closes all the way, defeating the purpose.  Furthermore, the clip is just as fragile. The handle that opens & closes the clasp snaps off much too easily, rendering the clip useless. I had to replace both so many times that after 6 months, I gave up entirely & went with another brand, MAM. Both the pacifier & the clip are made of much sturdier materials & the design of the clip is such that the moving parts are much less likely to break off. You're better off just keeping pacifier wipes handy for when it gets dirty. The cost of replacing the pacifier & clip so often far exceeds the cost of the wipes.

"i recently purchased this gate and installed it in just a couple of minutes.  i don't have kids.  i have a dog and a bird.  dog wanted to go in bird's room and tear up newspaper and scavange around, dragging stuff around the house making a mess.  that had to stop.  so i got this gate to put in the doorway of the bird's room.  the very cool thing, to me anyway (easily entertained), was that i could install it in the door frame and it didn't interrupt use of the door so i could still close his door at night and keep it open during the day, leaving the baby gate there to block the dog from entering.<br /><br />the gate is powder-coated metal and is very sturdy and well made.  it feels secure and strong where i put it.  the gate opens pretty easily.  at first i had to get the feeling of it (push in button and lift a little bit to get it to clear the locked area) and it was a cinch after that.<br /><br />i love that you can push it all the way open (in either direction) and have it stay open when you want it that way.  or, just open it enough to go through it and let it fall closed.  since it can open out into either direction, that makes it more versatile because you can install it with the latch on either side, thereby allowing you to have it open to the left or right.<br /><br />i like it so much that i just ordered another one for my stairwell.  i don't want the dog going upstairs into my office when i'm not there and i've just been blocking the entrance at the top of the stairs with a sheet of styrofoam at night.  looks tacky.  i can put this down near the foot of the stairs and it will look much better, plus i can just leave it swung open during the day.<br /><br />i cannot think of anything i do not like about this gate.  the learning curve in getting it up right was very small.  i also like that you don't have to put screws or nails in the walls if you don't want.  the tension-mount works very well.  it also comes with 2 expansion panels.  i didn't use those with my first one, but will be using them for my stairwell.<br /><br />this is noteworthy - the gate has all straight lines, unlike the main picture they have here on the website currently.  the one with the curved outer bars is not the one that i received.  mine does say model #4910, just like in the description.  but i felt it was noteworthy to advise that this model has all straight bars.  see the variety of pictures they provided and some of them do reflect that.  ***see pictures i have loaded here showing one gate without extensions and the other using both extensions.***for my stairwell.    this is noteworthy - the gate has all straight lines, unlike the main picture they have here on the website currently.  the one with the curved outer bars is not the one that i received.  mine does say model #4910, just like in the description.  but i felt it was noteworthy to advise that this model has all straight bars.  see the variety of pictures they provided and some of them do reflect that.  ***see pictures i have loaded here showing one gate without extensions and the other using both extensions.***"	12/20/2011

"after reading the other reviews i was so excited to get these.... pumping seven or eight times a day, my nipples were getting quite sore....however.... i do not agree with many of the reviewers about these causing less pain...in fact, i find these hurt my breasts with their \\massaging\\ (really the plastic is just a little more flexible than the others so they flex a little at the cone part, hence \\massaging\\ the nipple) after the first time i thought i was going to have to trash them....but then i compared the amount of milk i got using them, and it was almost double that of the typical medela shields....so i tried again, and on a lighter suction, at a faster pace, and they were more tolerable. and to get such a better output....i suppose i can put up with the pain. i now alternate between the two types of shields. i also notice when i'm more \\full\\ i should go with the traditional ones, as the massaging shields hurt too badly. if you can stick with them, through the initial discomfort, the amount of milk you gain, (and in my case can freeze for future use,) is worth it. :) i would not suggest washing these in the dishwasher however....they are a hand wash/wipe only item else the shape will distort. i even notice after wearing them each time the shape changes a bit and so i rotate them each time on the attachments."	11/12/2011

It is sturdy, yet soft and comfortable for the baby.

They stay in place so much better than your ordinary pacifier.  Now you don't have to use one of those horrible clips to hold the pacifier onto your child's clothes.  The wubbanubs are also great for when it's time to lose the pacifier because the child doesn't want to carry it around so he gives it up himself.  I give these an A+ and wouldn't have a baby without one.  For those who say they would never give their baby a pacifier I say I can always take the pacifier away, but you are stuck with a child that sucks it's thumb!!!"	10/14/2011

"I ordered the Cutsie Caterpillar wubbanub for my daughter with hopes it would help keep the soothie in her mouth for longer than 2 seconds - and it did!! At 6-weeks old, she was able to wrap her arm around her bug, which helped keep the soothie in her mouth. This meant longer spurts of sleeping for her and me. She's now 5-months old and absolutely loves her bug. She's never far from it and can put it in her mouth all by herself. She'd be devastated if anything happened to it, so just ordered another one for back-up.<br /><br />At first I was concerned about keeping the plush part clean since it doesn't separate from the soothie, but it's a non-issue. The wubbanub washes very easily in the washing machine and air dries quickly. I just zip it inside a boppy slipcover before putting it in the wash so it doesn't get beat up by the machine.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for any parent who is frustrated when their baby's soothie keeps falling out of their mouth. Not only did it help our daughter keep it in her mouth, it gave her something to bond with as she falls asleep or needs comfort."	11/11/2011

"Ordered it 4 days ago and just received it today from RideOnDepot.com for 416.98 and no shipping. They have a pricey 25% restocking fee but after reading up on the 20 wheel double jogger, I felt the great write ups and the good deal they offered outweighed the risk of return. Was a little confusing to set up at first until I realized most of what the instructions said to do was already done. Pretty much just had to slide a couple of frame pieced together and pop the wheels on. Took the 16 month old twins out for a test drive. You very much get what you pay for! <br />Great lightweight stroller for running with the kiddies! Holds the road true and bends and sways a little with you and the road (a good thing). Our neighbor gave us their old InStep which they've outgrown and it pulled to the right, and was just not comfortable for running. While it's also great for walking (I also put a CD player in the under basket with Vivaldi's Four Seasons or something else calming for the kids like George Winston) if that's all one is going to do then one of those cheaper strollers with the flimsey swivel front wheel may be the better way to go. But if you're going to run some of the time with it, this is the best we've checked out. I assume the kids like it also as they were out in minutes. <br />Lighweight, holds the road great, I set the tires at about 43 lbs (40 to 65lb range) and the ride/run was comfy. Not fatiguing at all! Pleant of pockets for cell phone, water, cd player, even brought the mail in one of the pockets, great canopies and safety features: hand brakes, two wheel locks and wrist strap in case you fall on a hill and the red color stands out to passing motorists, I wasn't sure about the res at first but it really looks sharp against the black <br />it's a little pricier than we were planning on going but it's well worth every penny! Other than that I can't think of a con just yet. Maybe if don't have double doors like us and you need to bring it inside, you maywant to look into their easily collapsible Q model. <br />"	4/8/2005

All the packaging says is 3+ months so I bought this thinking they were a little bigger or more appropriate for a 3 month old than the original soothie.  My baby is a little over 3 months and liked them initially but they ended up making him more fussy and irritated his gums.  He is not teething and maybe when he does we will get these out again.  It is important to note that the packaging and the description here does not alert you to the fact that 3+ really means teething or with teeth.

She loves it! Initially I thought we would not use it, but as it happens, grandma popped it in her mouth while we were out one night when baby was only a few weeks old and it was an instant hit (we had previously only tried a couple other brands, which she rejected)  History was made and we have a slew of pictures to document her fondness! Only at over 5 months old now, it has become a bit of a distraction when trying to get her down: she loves to play with it (giraffe is what we have, which is totally cute) and the stuffed animal is something to tug on, thus pulling it out of her mouth.     I vowed to give this as future shower gifts and just sent the Ella Bella elephant one to my sister. I hope her new little one likes it, I haven't gotten any feedback yet. I have now been searching for a binky that is of similar feel but without the stuffed animal - something that won't be distracting for when we are trying to put her down. We will still use this one for awhile yet, though. Cleaning is not too much of an issue - can either throw it in the washing machine or hand wash to clean the animal."	8/23/2011

I had my son in July and 4 days after his birth we had to take him to the NICU because he had jaundice so bad.  While in the NICU the nurse asked us if he likes a pacifier.  I said I wasn't sure because we had given him one of those Nuk pacifiers and he spit it out and didn't like it.  She then order him the Red Dog Wubba Nub and he has been using it ever since! We liked them so much I ordered the Blue Horse for his diaper bag and got Green Frog for the downstairs in my house.  There is literally a Wubba Nub everywhere and We don't leave home with out it.  Kids love the plush animal and like the other reviewer stated it keeps the pacifier in the babies mouth.  The Wubba Nub for me has been a life safer cuz it has allowed me to give my son the pacifier without having to hold it ---so I can be off cleaning or doing other things and don't have to listen to a screaming baby.  They make a great gift too!!  Everywhere we go people are like what is that?  That is so cool?  I have never seen a pacifier like that.  Buy it you won't be sorry!!!	1/5/2008

I purchased this when she was only a few weeks old and she used it regularly for a couple of months.  It sat nicely on her chest, especially when she was in her car seat.  I love that the pacifier is attached to the little cuddly elephant because it makes it so much easier to find in the car, at night, in her crib, etc.  Our daughter also loves to hold on to it.  Even if she wasn't able to get the paci part back in her mouth she would often chomp on the legs or another part to keep herself happy.  The reason why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish you could switch out the type of pacifier.

"My husband and I received these pacifiers in orange while in the hospital after the birth of our daughter.  We had, as new parents, gone out an bought what we thought were great pacifiers (Tommee Tippee).  We quickly learned that what you think you will like vs. what you actually use is sometimes quite different.  I'm not sure if it was because she was born small, (roughly 5.5 lbs,) or because she just likes the feel, but our daughter refuses the TT pacis and instead prefers these alone. The nipple is more similar to a breast, and to a baby who is exclusively breastfed, I would imagine that it is more soothing. We ended up buying more of the Hawaii Medical Gumdrops because they are awesome.  They have a great one-piece design and a little handle that allows you to manipulate the pacifier in you little one's mouth.  I would highly recommend these to any parent."	10/29/2012

Single piece design is nice, and two different textures on the sides is good for choice.  The size of the nipple is much better then that big berry nubby thing that looks like a ring pacifier - that is way too big for her mouth and the nubs all over the nipple part seem to be uncomfortable for her.    What I don't like:    She is 4 months old now, we got it a month ago.  She is teething and chewing on things, but could not hold/manipulate this until recently for any length of time.  Wanted a nipple that she would suck on and the nubs would be right under her gums if she bit down - this doesn't have that, nubs are only on the sides.    It's still too big and bulky for her to do much - and we don't give her a pacifier during the day now except at naps.  So this was a bit of a waste of money for us.  Gave it 3 stars for quality - but it's really not proven very useful for our family."	11/3/2010

My daughter refused them all except the soothies. The Wubbanub is a Soothie pacifier with an animal attached. I saw a friend with a Wubbanubs so I ordered one to try. It's been a life saver!! At 6wks old she clings to the animal. The weight of the animal helps the pacifier stay in her mouth especially when she's laying on her back or in the car seat. A tip when using the a soothie style pacifier,  put a finger in the whole while she's sucking on it, they like the way it feels.  We have the monkey, giraffe and duck. The giraffe is her favorite. Not sure why its more expensive though. And, babies r us carries these for only $10.95<br /><br />Regarding cleaning, there are 3 ways to clean/sterilize them.<br />1. Boil : Put a ziplock bag around animal, dip pacifier part in a bowl boiling water and let soak for 5-10 mins. This sterlizes It. At the end of each day  I take a a paper towel with soap and hot water and wash the pacifier part.<br />2. Dishwasher : I used the bottle basket and put on top shelf of dishwasher. Then let air dry. I washed our monkey this way.<br />3. Washing machine : put in garment bag and wash.  Let air dry. Do not put in dryer."	11/27/2012

It is the only kind he will use.  We tried the Soothie brand but he had a hard time keeping it in his mouth.  It was like it was at the wrong angle in his mouth because of the circular shape and it resting against his nose.  I discovered these and thought I'd give them a try.  They worked like a charm.  He has never had an issue keeping these in his mouth because there is nothing pushing against his nose when he sucks, and because of the contoured shape.    Now I will say that it would be nice if the entire pacifier was solid silicone like the Soothise pacifier is.  I had 2 of the Gum Drop pacifiers begin to peel away along the inside where the internal hard plastic form is.  I contacted the seller who directed me to the Manufacturer.  They were more than appologetic and sent replacements and also a return envelope for the damaged pacifiers.  They seemed genuinely shocked that this had happened to 2 of my pacifiers.  Despite this issue with a few of the GumDrop pacifiers, I still think they are an excellent product.  When you manufacture thousands, if not millions, of pacifiers there is bound to be a few defective ones that slip past quality control.  I do not think that should negate the fact that this is an awesome product."	12/28/2010

He really seems to find these soft and pliable pacifiers to be very comforting, and I like that they were designed with breastfeeding babies in mind.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they do break down rather quickly and need to be replaced about every 4-6 weeks.

But this con is heavily outweight by the pros.<br />You cannot detach the pacifier from the toy for washing.  Some may not mind, but I do not wan't laundry soap residue on the pacifer.

Once the baby is older, you can remove the part that makes the noise and use it as bear to sleep with. It looked safe enough to me to let a small child play with. I checked the eyes on the bear and they felt very secure. I thought it was a great value because I wanted my grandson to have a teddy bear and also something that would help him go to sleep.I am a bear collector, so I am picky about the bears I like to buy.

We received a Wabbanub as a gift (a bear) and he liked it. I wanted another so that we could have one at home and one at daycare.  We have not tried other types of pacifiers so I can't compare them, but my son took to the Wabbanub right away (we introduced it around 6 weeks).  He can hold on to the animal part when it's in his mouth and usually manuver it back in when it falls out.  He primarily uses it in the car and at daycare.  My one complaint is about cleaning it. I have been hand washing the pacifier part with dish soap and really hot water. The pacifier does not detach from the animal so I'm not sure how I'll clean that part when it gets really grimy. My niece has a similar pacifier but the stuffed animal and the pacifier come apart."	2/27/2011

"i've had this rack since our daughter's birth in february 2009.  we have the dr. brown's bottles with all their attendant pieces (which are really annoying to wash over and over again, but that's a different issue!), and have gone through the 4 oz. size and now use the 8 oz size.  in both cases we have had around 8 bottles \\active\\ at any one time and this rack is truly awesome in its capability to hold all the parts for that many bottles, due to its 2 tiers.  if we didn't have the tube-like inserts which go inside the bottle (to de-bubble the milk/formula), it could hold more bottles, but we use the top tier tines to hold those inserts, and it's perfect.  the bottles mostly go on the bottom rack tines, and all the other parts (caps, nipples, etc.) go in the middle.  other things like pacifiers, etc. can go there, too.  yes, the tines can come out pretty easily but in everyday use this has only happened a few times to me.  and no, this is not a good rack for glass bottles.  all in all, an awesome rack which appears to have much larger capacity than others, while still being (relatively) space-saving due to the 2-tier design."	12/26/2009

It was the gerber soft center pacifier in the big round bulb shape. I looked for 5 months EVERYWHERE for the same binky. No luck. I even called gerber, and the lady lied to me saying they never sold a bigger version of this kind of binky. She said it must have swollen to that size. Please. I have read quite a few blogs about other moms trying to find the same bigger version. Makes me wonder what they are hidding....I was so frustrated and ready to give up. Finaly I came across this site and it looked very similar to hers. After I read 2 reviews saying the same thing about the gerber binkys, I thought it was worth a try. As soon as I gave it to her, she loved it!! YEA!!! I also love the fact that it is one piece and natural.

"I purchased this product because I hated running in my son's room each time his pacifier kept falling out of his mouth... I just received this product today and I love it...it's super cute and it does what it's made for.  As soon as my lil man (2m old) went down for a nap, I decided to try it out.  It does stay where its suppose to, but I think My lil' man still needs to get use to the pacifier, for he turns his head to the side alot and the pacifier doesn't want to stay in his mouth. I just think he has to get use to the fact, that the pacifier isn't going anywhere and that he can still get it in his mouth (that's why I gave it 4 stars).  I love that while its on his chest, he can grab onto the dog...it's seems to comfort him a little.  I would highly recommend this product to any parent."	5/20/2011

It is not symmetrical and has an up and down side. So, in addition to be as hard to find as a regular pacifier, I still have to figure out in the dark which side is up and down.

"I came across this while searching for a pacifier holder, but thought it was INGENIOUS that they would attach a pacifier to a stuffed animal for the baby to hold.  My boy's only 6 weeks old and hasn't really gotten a grasp of holding onto things yet, but when we gave it to him, he seemed to really like it.  He already liked the SOOTHIE pacifiers so it wasn't a big deal.  I think as he gets a little older, he'll be able to hold onto the puppy better, but we think it was good for him to get a headstart and start holding onto it now.  Even when it falls out of his mouth, I like the fact that it doesn't go very far.  Sometimes he has a tendency to spit out his pacifier pretty far!

Also, other pacifiers are shaped too similarly to her milk bottles and she gets mad that milk doesn't come out of them. I also wasn't thrilled that you had to wash the paci with the toy. So being a crafty mom, i knew i could fix this so she would like it. I got it in the mail yesterday and as i predicted she just spit it out. so i took my seam ripper and got the pacifier off easily without hurting the toy. then i took one of the holders for the nam which come apart and there is a hole at the end where the tie for the clip goes through - it was the perfect size for the hole i had made. a few stitches and viola! popped the pacifier in the holder (i also like that it can spin around in the holder) and we were good to go. she had been crying for about 15 mins, i put it in her mouth, showed her how she could grab on to it and she was sleeping within minutes. she has fallen asleep with it 4 times since then. so, like i said - i loved the idea of this product but had to make it work for me. just an idea for some of you other crafty moms (or dads) out there ;)"	3/11/2011

"I'm a little jealous that many reviewers say that their kids took to this immediately! not my son. He looked at it with a little bit of interest, put it in his mouth and tossed it on the floor! I tried to leave it his play pen, crib, take it on car rides but he did not show any interest at all and so it went to the 'oh well I tried pile' and that's for that. In all fairness, I would like to add that perhaps it would work if we started our son on this right from the get go instead of introducing it after his regular pacifier because he seems to like one particular brand of pacifiers and the one day I bought a different type that was shaped 'to fit his mouth better' it promptly flew to the floor."	6/3/2012

Even on a pacifier holder, they would fall onto his clothes or blanket & pick up dust and hair instantly. So to say I was excited about this product would be an understatement. Here is what I wish I had known before I purchased it:    The keep-it-kleen pacifiers DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE! They have a mechanism that keeps the cover open, until it is jarred/knocked, at which point it snaps shut. This is great for pacifiers that fall on a hard floor from a substantial height, but when it just gently rolls or falls from my son's mouth when he is in his car seat or stroller, the impact is not enough to make it close, so it just stays open, lying on his shirt/blanket/whatever picking up hair.     Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, it does not have very good air flow, so the inside of the pacifier tends to fog up instantly and I'm not sure this is very hygienic.    In summary, I guess that a pacifier that closes some of the times it is dropped is better than one that never closes (ie a regular pacifier), but for the price, and the fact that it doesn't work in both large and small drops, I would not recommend it."	2/11/2010

"the 4 & 3/4:  i bought this car seat, like many other people, because it is top of the line here in the states. i am a very frugal person, so dropping $200 something on a car seat is very uncharacteristic of me. however, there are things you skimp on: hand me down clothes, second had toys, etc. the safety of my child just wasn't one of those things. this car seat is miles ahead of the infant carrier car seat we had when my daughter was first born. being frugal, before my daughter was born, i bought infant carrier car seat because it came with a stroller it connected with. my daughter out grew the weight & height requirement by the time she turned 10 months old. for what i spent on that car seat, vs what i spend on the britax and how long it will last her, i feel like i got ripped off on the earlier car seat. not only did she out grow it quickly, but it was complicated to snap her in, and although i had it latched down and had the seat belt through it and ratcheted tight, it still moved when i went over bumps.     going from that to our now installed britax was night and day. it is so easy to get her in and out of this, there are even little velcro patches on the sides that you can stick the straps to to get her in and out easier. the clicking system is great for knowing when it's just snug enough, i find that it takes between 2-3 clicks to have it snug enough, but it's reassuring to hear the clicks (it's also great for her grandparents). my daughter is still rear facing and i really like that it has a rebound strap that connects to the floor. i also like that she will be able to remain rear facing until she is 35 pounds, all the safer for her. i don't think i will ever buy anything but britax again.    the 1/4 star left off:    (note: i don't list expenses as a con, because i feel like i have gotten what i paid for)    1.) it was difficult to install in the rear facing position. we had a car seat check done (i would highly recommend this, these people put in a lot of hours to learn how to keep our kids strapped in safe and properly, and their services are free! it's worth 30 minutes out of your saturday), and we had done it mostly right, but even the car seat tech had a bit hard time getting it into just the right position (she also raved about the britax car seat and told us advantages about it we were unaware of).     2.) the seat - although it doesn't move a smidgen left to right (love that) - actually slips down towards the back of the seat of the car making my daughter more reclined back (i hope that made sense). i think this is because of the angle of our leather seats. kind of annoying, but quick and easy to scooch it back into place.    3.) this thing is big. and takes up a lot of room. i can't see this fitting in a smaller car rear facing. it just barely fits rear facing in our sequoia in the center spot (i know it wouldn't fit behind the seats with them pushed all the way back - my hubby and i are both 6 ft+, so that's a bit of a downer if we had to have her on the side).for that reason, and the difficulty of installing it rear facing initially (i think i could do it okay again on my own, i just don't want to mess with it), i have never taken this car seat out of the car, instead i always offer to drive. because again a) it's a little tricky to install (mostly because it is so big) and b) it is so big :).     that being said, i really love this car seat and feel so good about having made this purchase and have recommend it to friends and family. i love knowing that my little one is safe, secure, and pretty darn cozy in her car seat."	12/11/2009

Both Soothie and the newer version, the Gumdrop, have been real lifesavers for us. They don't cause nipple confusion in breastfeeding infants, and don't cause nipple pain for mommy!<br /><br />They can be a choking hazard, which is why there are warnings that when the baby can fit the entire pacifier (including the ring outside the nipple) into their mouth, it's time to get rid of the pacifier. The company punched holes in the ring in case a baby does try to swallow the entire pacifier, so the baby will be able to breathe until they get medical help.<br /><br />Wonderful item for upset babies or to help a baby fall asleep, but I don't recommend leaving it alone with an unsupervised infant."	9/18/2009

It fits very nicely, with no gaps, but I was a little put off by the material.  We have a firm crib mattress from Da Vinci at home, and this mattress seemed much more firm.  It's also covered in plastic, not fabric; although it's nice not to need a waterproof mattress pad, it winds up being very noisy if your baby moves, rustling the sheet against the plastic.  I would have preferred a fabric cover, and either buying a waterproof pad myself if I was using the mattress a lot, or just forgoing it and risking ruining the mattress, since it's fairly inexpensive and we were only using it for a short time.<br /><br />I know these aren't huge issues, but the bottom line is that my baby did not sleep well on it, and since we were in the same room, neither did we.  She adjusted quickly to the new surroundings and napped just fine in her usual Rock 'n Play, so I don't think it was just the fact that we were traveling.  She fidgeted the entire night (which kept us up all night with the rustling on the plastic!) and woke up much more frequently.  It was, however, an improvement over the 'mattress' that comes with the Pack 'n Play, and for the price, I am glad that we purchased it.  If you are using the Pack 'n Play as a primary place for sleeping, though, I would try to find something more like a regular crib mattress."	1/3/2013

She can get it in and out of her mouth easily in the car or at home, which is great.  If she sees it somewhere, she will focus on it until she gets it. She absolutely loves this thing. We bought two more (another elephant and a caterpillar). The elephant is my favorite because it's body is bigger and easier for her to grab. Basically, if we were stuck on a desert island and only allowed one baby item, this would be it. No question about it."	2/17/2013

Then Gerber mindlessly 'revamped' the soft center to what it is today. The customer service rep said that 'Gerber didn't think babies would notice the change' - well, he did. He sucked on the same two pacifiers until I found the Natursutten - a year later. Although they are exceedingly more expensive, I purchased five and retired the Gerber. My son barely noticed the change, even though the base is a little wider (the part where his lips meet together). Thanks again.

Now, it may seem that why not use just the strap - well, the strap is the SECOND saftey mechanism for the seat...and really should not be used as the only one b/c when you move the stroller the seat moves around....the latch is for a reason, and if you cannot securely latch the carrier - they should NEVER instruct you to be able to use it - just to make the $$.

The company that manufactires them makes a sturdier rubber version that cannot be bitten through, called the Super Soothie. However, i tried buying them for my daughter and she HATED them and ONLY uses the Soothie (has never taken any other pacifier.) She LOVES them. She is 2 now so she is ready to gradually wean from the pacifier altogether. And yes she has chewed a hole in one or two of them but no harm done!
